										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Every year the NBA draft is followed by millions of eager basketball fans around the world, as the most promising international and college prospects are chosen. The first picks typically go to the worst teams from the previous season, within a system that is aimed at making the NBA competitive. Nevertheless, it’s also a system with some glaring flaws, which includes encouraging teams to underperform and tank, in order to get better picks.</p>



<p>Perhaps the best example of a team tanking during the 2019-20 season is the Golden State Warriors. This is the same franchise which has dominated the NBA in recent years, reaching five consecutive NBA Finals since 2015 and winning the championship three times. Now they are completely unrecognizable, rock-bottom of the Western Conference and the first team to be mathematically eliminated from playoff contention.</p>



<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aZ5n0pPX5wU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>The Milwaukee Bucks convincingly top the Eastern Conference and the Los Angeles Lakers dominate in the Western Conference, with both tipped as favorites to reach the Finals prior to the enforced break, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://extra.bet365.com/news/en/US-Sports/NBA" target="_blank">according to the NBA betting on bet365</a>, yet casual observers are unable to understand why the Golden State Warriors aren’t up there competing with them. The answer is quite simple – the Warriors are tanking to ensure they get better draft options.</p>



<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WlvU4XlGQy4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>In the world of competitive professional sports, it might be hard to comprehend a situation whereby losing can be regarded as ultimately more rewarding than winning. However, this is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://allthingsnba.news.blog/2019/03/23/the-nba-draft-lottery-paradox/" target="_blank">the paradox created by the NBA draft system</a>. The aim of the draft is noble, for sure, because it gives the worst teams each season a chance to improve.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, it also creates a situation whereby franchises can exploit that noble aim. Since the introduction of the NBA draft Lottery, the odds are stacked heavily in favor of the worst teams for the first four picks. This means they will get the best new players entering the NBA. Ahead of the next NBA draft, the Golden State Warriors are the worst team in either conference, which means they have the joint-best odds of landing the highest-ranked players.</p>



<p>As this <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1160424-golden-state-warriors-why-the-warriors-tanking-is-hurting-the-nba" target="_blank">2012 article published by Bleacher Report highlights</a>, it’s not the first time the Warriors have looked ahead to the draft, rather than focus on winning. Back then, the way they concluded the season was called into question, apparently valuing better draft options above the prestige of competing to finish higher in the league rankings. 2019-20 results have been so bad, it seems like the Warriors are taking the same approach to a new extreme.</p>



<p>In some regards, this has created a race to the bottom where GM’s value first picks in the draft, along with the chance to sign a potential All-Star player, ahead of team performance during a season that isn’t going so well. For this reason alone, it’s clear that the draft system needs to be constantly reviewed and revised.</p>



<p>Some have suggested a completely open lottery, with no preferential order amongst teams in the draft system based around conference positions from the previous season. Perhaps this approach would discourage teams from tanking, and restore the purity of competition to the NBA, with teams aiming to perform within the best of their capabilities; rather than keep one eye on what the next draft might offer instead. However, that could take away the parity across the league that the draft seeks to enforce, so there is no clear solution, but the current system is certainly flawed.</p>

<p>Although they are all a part of the gambling industry sports betting and online casinos have quite a notable number of differences.</p>



<p>However, online sports betting and online casinos have become the most popular ways that people are using to make real money online.</p>



<p>Due to this, there is always debate on which is the best one to work with when it comes to cashing in the big bucks.</p>



<p>With this in mind, here are some of the differences you should expect to find when betting with these online platforms.</p>



<p><strong>The Winning Odds</strong></p>



<p>According to a blog at <a href="https://www.cinemacasino.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="cinemacasino (opens in a new tab)">cinemacasino</a> sports betting and online casinos have a major difference when it comes to wagering and calculating your winning odds.</p>



<p>For instance, you have to use a sportsbook who have a fixed amount of money according to their requirements.</p>



<p>On the other hand, online casino games have random cash prizes. You can win $10000 from Mega Moolah while the next person wins millions.</p>



<p>Also, online casino wagering has what we call a house edge. Usually, this is what most online gamblers use to calculate their winning odds.</p>



<p>Contrary, sports bettors mainly use the probability technique to calculate their winning odds.</p>



<p>Also, bettors are forced to pay more money their intended wager due to the betting operational fees. </p>



<p><strong>Gambling Time Limits</strong></p>



<p>Unlike online casino games, sports betting is not always available for you anytime you need to make some real money online.</p>



<p>For example, if you are into soccer betting, you can only place a bet when there is a match or during the soccer league.</p>



<p>Whereas. Casino games are there for you to enjoy whenever you need them.</p>



<p><strong>Fun Betting Choices</strong></p>



<p>Online <a href="https://en.crazyvegas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="us casinos (opens in a new tab)">us casinos</a> have over a thousand slot games you can pick from. To make it even more fun, the games come with different cartoons, movies and contemporary comic book themes.</p>



<p>This is contrary to the monotonous nature of sports betting.</p>

<p>The current football season has witnessed some highs and lows. From the dressing rooms, the pitch and the dugout, the football world has witnessed some exceptional drama.</p>



<p>Goals galore, records have been broken, some spellbound moments with managerial changes coming into effect.</p>



<p>We have surely been part of a crazy rollercoaster of managerial changes across Europe. Most managers have been sacked due to some dismal performances from their teams.</p>



<p>According to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="ausportsbetting.org (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.ausportsbetting.org/" target="_blank">ausportsbetting.org</a> one of the prime examples of a club that discards its managers is Watford. The Premier League side has sacked the likes of Javi Garcia and Quique Sanchez Flores this season after a poor run of results. </p>



<p>The two managers joined the list of high profile managers without a job currently.</p>



<p><strong>Unai Emery</strong></p>



<p>Ever since the Spaniard was shown the exit door by the Arsenal hierarchy. He has maintained a low profile without a job.</p>



<p>Unai Emery took over Arsenal after Arsene Wenger departed the club in the 2016-17 season. The seed of downfall for Unai Emery was sown in Baku during the Europa League Final against Chelsea. It was the last nail to the coffin.</p>



<p>This is when the Gunners lost 4-1 to their London rivals. Nevertheless, Arsenal started another season in underwhelming style. And the powers that be at Arsenal were very quick to send Unai Emery packing.</p>



<p><strong>Mauricio Pochettino</strong></p>



<p>Regarded as one of the best tacticians in the European elite. There is no doubt that Pochettino was all set to start a dynasty at Tottenham Hotspurs.</p>



<p>It came as a surprise when the world heard the news that Spurs have sacked Pochettino. After taking them to the UEFA Champions League Finals against Liverpool. Despite, Pochettino side punching above their weights hilariously, Spurs went on and sack the Spaniard.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, the German giants Bayern Munich have eyed Mauricio Pochettino. Bayern Munich are looking for a long-term replacement for Hans-Dieter Flick who is currently in charge until the end of the season.</p>



<p>With all the crazy managerial changes that are taking place in the world of football. You can place your bets at your favourite <a href="https://www.bestusaonlinecasinos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="online casinos (opens in a new tab)">online casinos</a> or sportsbook on where these managers will end up coaching next season. </p>

<p>Best Rated Olympic SportsThe Olympic Games are around the corner. And with so many games that will be aired at the same time, you may fail to find which sports to keep you entertained. That is why below we have a few sports that we are sure that you will find interesting during the Olympic Games.</p>



<p><strong>Top Rated Olympic Sports</strong></p>



<p><em>Gymnastics</em></p>



<p>While we can do most of the sports in our backyards, this one is not one of them. There is something about gymnastics that makes you wonder just how agile a person can be. </p>



<p>We talk of the breath-taking stunts as well as the way they manage to seamlessly add music to them. Gymnastics is one of the most fascinating sports ever. </p>



<p><em>Track Events</em></p>



<p>What’s not love about track and field events? They have both teams as individual events making them ideal for anyone wanting to have an adrenaline rush.</p>



<p>If these do not get your blood rushing, then we suggest online casino games at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="bestcasinositesonline (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.bestcasinositesonline.com/" target="_blank">bestcasinositesonline</a>. They can literally be sitting at the edge of the east especially if you are playing for real money.</p>



<p><em>Swimming</em></p>



<p>Watching the way that some people swim during the Olympics will have you wondering if mermaids really exist. Fine we understand that on land you are fast. However, this is the water and humans aren’t designed to live in water. This is what makes swimming a fascinating sport during the Olympics. </p>



<p><em>Wrestling, Taekwondo and Judo</em></p>



<p>These are also another set of some fascinating sports. A lot of people love action movies and with this they get to see if all those stunts during the movies are actually doable.</p>



<p><em>Volleyball, Beach and Field</em></p>



<p>Volleyball is another of the top rated Olympic sports as we’ve seen at <a href="https://www.newzealandcasinos.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="online casinos nz (opens in a new tab)">online casinos nz</a> sites. One of the things that made this sport so favourable was that from the beginning of the Olympic Games it was a sport that both men and women could play. As such attracting a large fan base.  </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>More Americans play basketball than any other sport and the popularity of this pastime continues to grow across the country. The NBA is also watched by millions of fans around the world with countries such as Canada, Australia and China amongst the most dedicated. As a result, this 30-team league is also incredibly popular with sports bettors and with each team playing 82 times throughout the regular season, there are always plenty of opportunities to get involved. There are hundreds of markets available ahead of each and every game and we take a look at three important aspects to consider before placing a wager on the sport. </p>



<p><strong>Focus on Specific Teams and Divisions </strong></p>



<p>The average bettor is unlikely to have time to follow the fortunes of all 30 franchises and it is possible to tie yourself in knots whilst trying to keep up with every single match throughout the course of the season. With fixtures taking place most nights and teams taking to the court every couple of days, newcomers may find the sheer volume of matches extremely overwhelming.</p>



<p>It is strongly advised to choose just a handful of sides to follow, paying particular attention to team news, match reports and camp morale. If you can follow their progress on TV, this will also prove beneficial. Alternatively, you could opt to hone in on a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="particular division such as the Central Division (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nba.com/standings/2019/division" target="_blank">particular division such as the Central Division</a> or the Pacific Division. This should allow for more in-depth analysis and subsequently result in far more informed picks.</p>



<p><strong>Be Wary of Back-to-Back Games</strong></p>



<p>Squeezing so many games into a relatively short period of time can result in teams playing back-to-back games on consecutive nights. Although this can help build up momentum, it may also prove to be a hindrance. Lack of recovery time can affect a player&#8217;s ability to perform and if a team has been involved in an energy-sapping contest, they may struggle to reach the same heights 24 hours later. This is particularly prevalent over the festive period and even the highest-ranked teams can struggle with the demanding fixture list.</p>



<p>In 2019, high-flying Miami Heat, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="who are +800 in the NBA betting (opens in a new tab)" href="https://extra.bet365.com/news/en/US-Sports/NBA" target="_blank">who are +800 in the NBA betting</a> to finish top of the Eastern Conference, saw their good form halted by a surprise defeat to the Washington Wizards. This came immediately off the back of a draining 117-116 overtime victory against the 76ers and was also their third game in four nights. Fatigue had clearly taken its toll.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MIAvsWAS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MIAvsWAS</a>: Coach Spo calls timeout to talk this one over&#8230;<br><br>HEAT trailing the Wizards 87-69 with 4:22 remaining in the 3rd quarter. Down, but not out. <a href="https://t.co/xWfkL1u3QB">pic.twitter.com/xWfkL1u3QB</a></p>&mdash; Miami HEAT (@MiamiHEAT) <a href="https://twitter.com/MiamiHEAT/status/1211825472901914624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>




<p><em><strong>Beware of Market Reactions</strong></em></p>



<p>Injuries are part and parcel of the game and it is highly likely that every NBA side will suffer a number of setbacks throughout the course of the campaign. The markets can react quite strongly in favor of the opposition whenever a star player picks up an injury, although it may be occasionally worth swimming against the tide. The Bucks&#8217; odds drifted following the news that superstar forward <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Giannis Antetokounmpo had picked up a back injury (opens in a new tab)" href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2868774-bucks-giannis-antetokounmpo-out-for-2nd-straight-game-due-to-back-injury" target="_blank">Giannis Antetokounmpo had picked up a back injury</a>, however, the Milwaukee outfit still won each of the two games without the Greek-born star. Most coaches will have contingency plans in place and value can often by unearthed by backing the top sides to overcome these small setbacks.</p>

<p>Successful wagering on the NBA requires substantial patience and dedication, but savvy sports bettors should still be able to find plenty of betting opportunities throughout the course of the season. Following these three tips will hopefully help keep you on the winning track and make it much simpler to follow this fantastic competition.</p>

<p>The qualifying rounds for next year’s European Championships are drawing to a close, so now is a perfect time to recap on what we’ve seen so far and weigh up the chances of the main contenders.</p>



<p>Euro 2020 will celebrate the 60th anniversary of the international competition, which is why UEFA have decided to mix things up a little bit this time around. Rather than one or two host countries, a grand total of 12 nations will have the honour of hosting different matches throughout the tournament. The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="final is set to be held in London’s Wembley Stadium (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.wembleystadium.com/uefa-euro-2020" target="_blank">final is set to be held in London’s Wembley Stadium</a> on 12 July.</p>



<p>As reigning champions, Portugal will once again turn to talisman Cristiano Ronaldo as they look to retain their Euro crown. That said, there are a handful of other teams that have shown incredible intent during the qualifying rounds, many of which find themselves tipped to take home the trophy themselves. Let’s take a closer look.</p>



<p><strong>France – 4/1</strong></p>



<p>Hot off the back of their World Cup triumph in Russia last year, head coach Didier Deschamps will be confident of going all the way once again with his dynamic French side. Les Blues count the likes of Kylian Mbappe, Antoine Griezmann and N&#8217;Golo Kante among their ranks, as well as a host of other top talent jostling for position in both the starting eleven and on the bench.</p>



<p>Their qualifying campaign has offered no signs that the world champions will be easily toppled, so it’s no surprise to find the team currently listed as 4/1 favourites according to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="latest international football betting odds at bet365. (opens in a new tab)" href="https://extra.bet365.com/news/en/football/international-football" target="_blank">latest international football betting odds at bet365.</a></p>



<p><strong>England – 5/1</strong></p>



<iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FEnglandTeam%2Fphotos%2Fa.10150621820502447%2F10156267086727447%2F%3Ftype%3D3&#038;width=500" width="500" height="459" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>



<p>Following a noteworthy run to the semi-finals at last year’s World Cup, it’s fair to say that this young England squad have established a solid foundation to build on. Gareth Southgate will be pleased with his team’s showing throughout the qualifying rounds, particularly <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="the goalscoring threat of Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling. (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.thefa.com/england/mens-seniors/squad/raheem-sterling" target="_blank">the goalscoring threat of Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling.</a></p>



<p>It’s hard to remember the last time England entered a major international competition in such an optimistic light, only narrowly listed behind France as favourites to go all the way next June. Yes, the squad boasts plenty of fresh talent, though a large part of their recent success is down to Southgate’s long-term focus on sports psychology and commitment to developing a strong collective mentality.</p>



<p><strong>Belgium – 7/1</strong></p>



<iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FBelgianRedDevils%2Fphotos%2Fa.123067354504678%2F1733438013467596%2F%3Ftype%3D3&#038;width=500" width="500" height="391" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>



<p>Led by manager Roberto Martinez, this crop of Belgian talent really is something special. In fact, few teams in contention for the Euro 2020 trophy can match the sheer depth of talent that Belgium has to offer. Midfield dynamo Kevin de Bruyne is at the heart of their play, so it’ll be interesting to see how different sides intent to subdue the obvious playmaking threat he poses. Even beyond De Bruyne, there’s also the likes of Eden Hazard, Romelu Lukaku and Dries Mertens to deal with.</p>



<p>Belgium have never won a major international tournament, having previously lost the European Championship final in 1980. They’ll be hoping to go one better this time around.</p>



<p>So, there we have it: our three top picks that look set to go very deep into the latter stages of next year’s Euro 2020. Who’s your money on?</p>

<p>After an incredibly <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="bright start to their Euro 2020 qualification bid (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47578575" target="_blank">bright start to their Euro 2020 qualification bid</a>, England are in the driving seat as far as progressing to the finals is concerned and, although it is a tournament that will be hosted across the continent, it does have the air of a home championships at the same time.</p>



<figure><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KpNcoYNfbOs" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure>



<p>That’s because one of the final four meetings and the showpiece event itself, are to be held at England’s Wembley Stadium and this means the Three Lions could be playing some highly important fixtures in very familiar surroundings.</p>



<p>The last time England hosted the European Championships was back in 1996 and it really was the summer in which football did come home. Although Terry Venables’ men were denied an appearance in the final by Germany, it is a tournament that lives long in the memory.</p>



<p>While although the summer of ’96 is now etched in football folklore as far as England fans are concerned, it is perhaps time to stop looking to the past and instead look to what is on offer in this present day and age.</p>



<p></p>



<p>That’s because England have been the nearly-men of international football in the last two years and, after semi-final appearances at both the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA Nations League, the belief is that now is their time.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a belief that is shared by pundits and punters alike; <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="a look at the current international football betting (opens in a new tab)" href="https://extra.bet365.com/news/en/football/international-football" target="_blank">a look at the current international football betting</a> has this young squad well placed to end their international trophy drought – a drought that is now 53 years and counting.</p>



<p>With England currently priced at 9/2 second-favorites with bet365, there is not much standing between them and being kings of Europe next summer. However, that’s not to say they will go unchallenged either.</p>



<p>When discussing the runners and riders for Euro 2020, one cannot leave France out of the conversation and, as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="current World Champions (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/15/france-croatia-world-cup-final-match-report" target="_blank">current World Champions</a>, they will be looking to emulate the achievements of the previous generation some twenty years prior.</p>



<figure><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GrsEAvRerTg" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure>



<p>Back in 2000, David Trezeguet scored a Golden-Goal extra-time winner against Italy, which meant that this legendary French team added the European Championship to their first-ever World Cup win two years before.</p>



<p>Not only that, but France will be looking to go one better after losing in the final of Euro 2016 and, with the rich pedigree that this talented group of players have, it comes as no surprise that bet365 have made them 7/2 favourites to win a third European Championship next year.</p>



<p>Much will depend on the likes of Barcelona’s Antoine Griezmann and Manchester United’s Paul Pogba, who, in the case of the latter, has a recent tendency to play better for his country rather than this club.</p>



<p>Much will depend on the likes of Barcelona’s Antoine Griezmann and Manchester United’s Paul Pogba, who, in the case of the latter, has a recent tendency to play better for his country rather than this club.</p>



<p>However, if they fail to lead France to success, then a certain Harry Kane will be lying in wait and what better sight would there be for English football than the Tottenham forward lifting the Henri Deulauney trophy in front of his countrymen. Time will tell if this fantasy becomes a reality.</p>

<p><strong>Sports Betting Tips and Predictions</strong></p>



<p>It’s important to learn a few important things about online betting. This goes regardless of which country you’re coming from – if you’re from UK or someplace else. That being said, there is timeless advice to be learned by online betting. And the earlier you know it – the better off you will be. So, read more about some of the most important elements of successful online betting.</p>



<p><strong>Screening the playground</strong></p>



<p>If you want to be successful in online betting – then you need knowledge of the playground. It gets difficult to do this once you realize the vastness of the playground. There are dozens of different sports to consider and hundreds or more of individual games. And then you need to consider the individual differences between all of these categories. It’s not an easy task and few can brag that they have done it. But you don’t need to make things difficult for yourself – more than they already are. What you can do is zone in on one particular aspect of in the sports itself and to bet on that. It could be one type of betting, one sport, one country or one league or even one team. Learn all you can about it. And then apply your knowledge. Recently we heard of one player that only using <a href="https://www.bettingtipsnigeria.com/betting-sites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">betting sites in Nigeria</a> to place his bets. To specialise in Nigerian or another African country could be a competitive advantage.</p>



<p><strong>Pick the best betting sites</strong></p>



<p>We’re speaking primarily about online betting now. But this goes for regular betting, too. The site that you will select has the power to dramatically change your experience. Nobody would like using a broken down website. For that matter – nobody would like to use the services of a shady betting site. To that end, only seek out the highest-quality betting platforms (like for example the ones using <a href="https://kambi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kambi</a>). They will guarantee that you will have the best experience and the best possible odds.</p>



<p><strong>Be prepared to lose in order to win in the long run</strong></p>



<p>Not a single person was born an expert in the field of online betting. It takes practice and years of dedication before you develop expertise. And of course – this can be costly. The process isn’t easy and it’s rather long. But if you pay attention to the right things – then you will be able to reap your rewards down the line. One recommendation is to use new betting and casino sites. They often offer more generous bonus offer than established ones. Find the <a href="https://casinoviking.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">latest new casino sites at CasinoViking</a> that offer fantastic welcome bonuses to UK players. There are also other many other website that you can use to compare and find new betting and casino sites.</p>



<p>These are some of the most important tips that you should have in mind when it comes to online betting. These advices apply to betting all around the world. We hope that you will have a fantastic time applying these tips when betting.</p>
