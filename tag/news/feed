<p>Although they are all a part of the gambling industry sports betting and online casinos have quite a notable number of differences.</p>



<p>However, online sports betting and online casinos have become the most popular ways that people are using to make real money online.</p>



<p>Due to this, there is always debate on which is the best one to work with when it comes to cashing in the big bucks.</p>



<p>With this in mind, here are some of the differences you should expect to find when betting with these online platforms.</p>



<p><strong>The Winning Odds</strong></p>



<p>According to a blog at <a href="https://www.cinemacasino.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="cinemacasino (opens in a new tab)">cinemacasino</a> sports betting and online casinos have a major difference when it comes to wagering and calculating your winning odds.</p>



<p>For instance, you have to use a sportsbook who have a fixed amount of money according to their requirements.</p>



<p>On the other hand, online casino games have random cash prizes. You can win $10000 from Mega Moolah while the next person wins millions.</p>



<p>Also, online casino wagering has what we call a house edge. Usually, this is what most online gamblers use to calculate their winning odds.</p>



<p>Contrary, sports bettors mainly use the probability technique to calculate their winning odds.</p>



<p>Also, bettors are forced to pay more money their intended wager due to the betting operational fees. </p>



<p><strong>Gambling Time Limits</strong></p>



<p>Unlike online casino games, sports betting is not always available for you anytime you need to make some real money online.</p>



<p>For example, if you are into soccer betting, you can only place a bet when there is a match or during the soccer league.</p>



<p>Whereas. Casino games are there for you to enjoy whenever you need them.</p>



<p><strong>Fun Betting Choices</strong></p>



<p>Online <a href="https://en.crazyvegas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="us casinos (opens in a new tab)">us casinos</a> have over a thousand slot games you can pick from. To make it even more fun, the games come with different cartoons, movies and contemporary comic book themes.</p>



<p>This is contrary to the monotonous nature of sports betting.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>More Americans play basketball than any other sport and the popularity of this pastime continues to grow across the country. The NBA is also watched by millions of fans around the world with countries such as Canada, Australia and China amongst the most dedicated. As a result, this 30-team league is also incredibly popular with sports bettors and with each team playing 82 times throughout the regular season, there are always plenty of opportunities to get involved. There are hundreds of markets available ahead of each and every game and we take a look at three important aspects to consider before placing a wager on the sport. </p>



<p><strong>Focus on Specific Teams and Divisions </strong></p>



<p>The average bettor is unlikely to have time to follow the fortunes of all 30 franchises and it is possible to tie yourself in knots whilst trying to keep up with every single match throughout the course of the season. With fixtures taking place most nights and teams taking to the court every couple of days, newcomers may find the sheer volume of matches extremely overwhelming.</p>



<p>It is strongly advised to choose just a handful of sides to follow, paying particular attention to team news, match reports and camp morale. If you can follow their progress on TV, this will also prove beneficial. Alternatively, you could opt to hone in on a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="particular division such as the Central Division (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nba.com/standings/2019/division" target="_blank">particular division such as the Central Division</a> or the Pacific Division. This should allow for more in-depth analysis and subsequently result in far more informed picks.</p>



<p><strong>Be Wary of Back-to-Back Games</strong></p>



<p>Squeezing so many games into a relatively short period of time can result in teams playing back-to-back games on consecutive nights. Although this can help build up momentum, it may also prove to be a hindrance. Lack of recovery time can affect a player&#8217;s ability to perform and if a team has been involved in an energy-sapping contest, they may struggle to reach the same heights 24 hours later. This is particularly prevalent over the festive period and even the highest-ranked teams can struggle with the demanding fixture list.</p>



<p>In 2019, high-flying Miami Heat, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="who are +800 in the NBA betting (opens in a new tab)" href="https://extra.bet365.com/news/en/US-Sports/NBA" target="_blank">who are +800 in the NBA betting</a> to finish top of the Eastern Conference, saw their good form halted by a surprise defeat to the Washington Wizards. This came immediately off the back of a draining 117-116 overtime victory against the 76ers and was also their third game in four nights. Fatigue had clearly taken its toll.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MIAvsWAS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MIAvsWAS</a>: Coach Spo calls timeout to talk this one over&#8230;<br><br>HEAT trailing the Wizards 87-69 with 4:22 remaining in the 3rd quarter. Down, but not out. <a href="https://t.co/xWfkL1u3QB">pic.twitter.com/xWfkL1u3QB</a></p>&mdash; Miami HEAT (@MiamiHEAT) <a href="https://twitter.com/MiamiHEAT/status/1211825472901914624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>




<p><em><strong>Beware of Market Reactions</strong></em></p>



<p>Injuries are part and parcel of the game and it is highly likely that every NBA side will suffer a number of setbacks throughout the course of the campaign. The markets can react quite strongly in favor of the opposition whenever a star player picks up an injury, although it may be occasionally worth swimming against the tide. The Bucks&#8217; odds drifted following the news that superstar forward <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Giannis Antetokounmpo had picked up a back injury (opens in a new tab)" href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2868774-bucks-giannis-antetokounmpo-out-for-2nd-straight-game-due-to-back-injury" target="_blank">Giannis Antetokounmpo had picked up a back injury</a>, however, the Milwaukee outfit still won each of the two games without the Greek-born star. Most coaches will have contingency plans in place and value can often by unearthed by backing the top sides to overcome these small setbacks.</p>

<p>Successful wagering on the NBA requires substantial patience and dedication, but savvy sports bettors should still be able to find plenty of betting opportunities throughout the course of the season. Following these three tips will hopefully help keep you on the winning track and make it much simpler to follow this fantastic competition.</p>

<p>The qualifying rounds for next year’s European Championships are drawing to a close, so now is a perfect time to recap on what we’ve seen so far and weigh up the chances of the main contenders.</p>



<p>Euro 2020 will celebrate the 60th anniversary of the international competition, which is why UEFA have decided to mix things up a little bit this time around. Rather than one or two host countries, a grand total of 12 nations will have the honour of hosting different matches throughout the tournament. The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="final is set to be held in London’s Wembley Stadium (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.wembleystadium.com/uefa-euro-2020" target="_blank">final is set to be held in London’s Wembley Stadium</a> on 12 July.</p>



<p>As reigning champions, Portugal will once again turn to talisman Cristiano Ronaldo as they look to retain their Euro crown. That said, there are a handful of other teams that have shown incredible intent during the qualifying rounds, many of which find themselves tipped to take home the trophy themselves. Let’s take a closer look.</p>



<p><strong>France – 4/1</strong></p>



<p>Hot off the back of their World Cup triumph in Russia last year, head coach Didier Deschamps will be confident of going all the way once again with his dynamic French side. Les Blues count the likes of Kylian Mbappe, Antoine Griezmann and N&#8217;Golo Kante among their ranks, as well as a host of other top talent jostling for position in both the starting eleven and on the bench.</p>



<p>Their qualifying campaign has offered no signs that the world champions will be easily toppled, so it’s no surprise to find the team currently listed as 4/1 favourites according to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="latest international football betting odds at bet365. (opens in a new tab)" href="https://extra.bet365.com/news/en/football/international-football" target="_blank">latest international football betting odds at bet365.</a></p>



<p><strong>England – 5/1</strong></p>



<iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FEnglandTeam%2Fphotos%2Fa.10150621820502447%2F10156267086727447%2F%3Ftype%3D3&#038;width=500" width="500" height="459" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>



<p>Following a noteworthy run to the semi-finals at last year’s World Cup, it’s fair to say that this young England squad have established a solid foundation to build on. Gareth Southgate will be pleased with his team’s showing throughout the qualifying rounds, particularly <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="the goalscoring threat of Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling. (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.thefa.com/england/mens-seniors/squad/raheem-sterling" target="_blank">the goalscoring threat of Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling.</a></p>



<p>It’s hard to remember the last time England entered a major international competition in such an optimistic light, only narrowly listed behind France as favourites to go all the way next June. Yes, the squad boasts plenty of fresh talent, though a large part of their recent success is down to Southgate’s long-term focus on sports psychology and commitment to developing a strong collective mentality.</p>



<p><strong>Belgium – 7/1</strong></p>



<iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FBelgianRedDevils%2Fphotos%2Fa.123067354504678%2F1733438013467596%2F%3Ftype%3D3&#038;width=500" width="500" height="391" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>



<p>Led by manager Roberto Martinez, this crop of Belgian talent really is something special. In fact, few teams in contention for the Euro 2020 trophy can match the sheer depth of talent that Belgium has to offer. Midfield dynamo Kevin de Bruyne is at the heart of their play, so it’ll be interesting to see how different sides intent to subdue the obvious playmaking threat he poses. Even beyond De Bruyne, there’s also the likes of Eden Hazard, Romelu Lukaku and Dries Mertens to deal with.</p>



<p>Belgium have never won a major international tournament, having previously lost the European Championship final in 1980. They’ll be hoping to go one better this time around.</p>



<p>So, there we have it: our three top picks that look set to go very deep into the latter stages of next year’s Euro 2020. Who’s your money on?</p>

<p>After an incredibly <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="bright start to their Euro 2020 qualification bid (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47578575" target="_blank">bright start to their Euro 2020 qualification bid</a>, England are in the driving seat as far as progressing to the finals is concerned and, although it is a tournament that will be hosted across the continent, it does have the air of a home championships at the same time.</p>



<figure><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KpNcoYNfbOs" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure>



<p>That’s because one of the final four meetings and the showpiece event itself, are to be held at England’s Wembley Stadium and this means the Three Lions could be playing some highly important fixtures in very familiar surroundings.</p>



<p>The last time England hosted the European Championships was back in 1996 and it really was the summer in which football did come home. Although Terry Venables’ men were denied an appearance in the final by Germany, it is a tournament that lives long in the memory.</p>



<p>While although the summer of ’96 is now etched in football folklore as far as England fans are concerned, it is perhaps time to stop looking to the past and instead look to what is on offer in this present day and age.</p>



<p></p>



<p>That’s because England have been the nearly-men of international football in the last two years and, after semi-final appearances at both the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA Nations League, the belief is that now is their time.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a belief that is shared by pundits and punters alike; <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="a look at the current international football betting (opens in a new tab)" href="https://extra.bet365.com/news/en/football/international-football" target="_blank">a look at the current international football betting</a> has this young squad well placed to end their international trophy drought – a drought that is now 53 years and counting.</p>



<p>With England currently priced at 9/2 second-favorites with bet365, there is not much standing between them and being kings of Europe next summer. However, that’s not to say they will go unchallenged either.</p>



<p>When discussing the runners and riders for Euro 2020, one cannot leave France out of the conversation and, as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="current World Champions (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/15/france-croatia-world-cup-final-match-report" target="_blank">current World Champions</a>, they will be looking to emulate the achievements of the previous generation some twenty years prior.</p>



<figure><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GrsEAvRerTg" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure>



<p>Back in 2000, David Trezeguet scored a Golden-Goal extra-time winner against Italy, which meant that this legendary French team added the European Championship to their first-ever World Cup win two years before.</p>



<p>Not only that, but France will be looking to go one better after losing in the final of Euro 2016 and, with the rich pedigree that this talented group of players have, it comes as no surprise that bet365 have made them 7/2 favourites to win a third European Championship next year.</p>



<p>Much will depend on the likes of Barcelona’s Antoine Griezmann and Manchester United’s Paul Pogba, who, in the case of the latter, has a recent tendency to play better for his country rather than this club.</p>

<p>However, if they fail to lead France to success, then a certain Harry Kane will be lying in wait and what better sight would there be for English football than the Tottenham forward lifting the Henri Deulauney trophy in front of his countrymen. Time will tell if this fantasy becomes a reality.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Originally being an activity primarily held at the weekend, the growing popularity and wider range of football fixtures has made it possible to create your own <a href="https://footyaccumulators.com/football-tips">tips for football betting daily </a>each week. All potential outcomes are covered by the extensive markets from the bookmakers, and additional competitions such as the Champions League, Europa League, EFL Cup and FA Cup allow for even more fixtures to place money on.</p>



<p>The masses of options for how you choose to make football betting tips are seen as a positive and a negative, making it easier to bet on exactly what you think is likely to happen, but also being seen as an obstacle for inexperienced punters who struggle to identify what to bet on.It’s likely that another football fixture is on the cards throughout the current week &#8211; as well as plenty of the expected weekend games &#8211; but if you’re looking to bet on one of the many weekday games, we’ve offered a helping hand on how to pick insightful football betting tips between Monday and Friday.</p>



<p><strong>Choose your football fixture(s)</strong></p>



<p>Bookmaker apps and websites provide odds on all scheduled matches several weeks in advance, making it possible to back your bets early and take the best price. Monday night football continues the selection of games at the weekend and you’ll often find a Friday night fixture to kick off the next weekend in a similar style, with games also often played between Tuesday and Thursday, especially for domestic and European competitions. Through choosing your match, which is likely to be from one of Europe’s more recognised leagues, you can create football betting tips as a single, introduce other games to make a football accumulator, or back an enhanced market that’s been boosted by your chosen bookmaker.</p>



<p><strong>Select your method of betting</strong></p>



<p>You might not realise it, but football betting tips come in all different shapes and sizes. With this being the case, you aren’t solely limited to predicting the match result, instead being given the opportunity to bet on every possible outcome over ninety minutes including over 2.5 goals, both teams to score, anytime goalscorers, and many other more extensive options. The bookies continue to cater to a more varied array of different markets to enhance your football betting tips, which helps massively as it prevents you from backing something else due to the fact that you can’t be specific with your football prediction.</p>



<p><strong>Back your bet at the biggest odds</strong></p>



<p>The last port of call for backing any bets is to assure
that you’re placing them at the biggest available odds. It’s easy to do this by
cross-referencing the price you’ve been given over all popular bookmakers, with
it being a worthwhile process as each bookie possesses a different price. You
shouldn’t base your football betting tips on the odds you’re being given, but
they can be an indication of their chances of landing, with higher odds often
meaning that the bookies are doubting that your bet will win.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Travelling across Europe to watch your favourite team play in the Champions League is never a cheap venture, but the amount can vary massively depending on the group stage draw.</p>
<p>This season Manchester City, Liverpool, Tottenham and Manchester United are all competing in Europe’s premier tournament, in the hope that they can propel English club football back to the top.</p>
<p>Manchester City are the current favourites to win the tournament and according to <a href="https://www.betfair.com/exchange/plus/football/competition/228" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Champions League betting</a>, they are 9/2, just ahead of Barcelona who are 5/1.</p>
<p><strong>Manchester City</strong></p>
<p>Despite being the favourites, City lost their opening game, as Lyon stunned the Premier League champions, winning 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium.</p>
<p>City have also travelled to their other two group stage opponents, Hoffenheim and Shakhtar Donetsk and picked up maximum points, renewing their hope of winning a first Champions League title.</p>
<p><strong>Liverpool</strong></p>
<p>The Reds finished as the runners-up in last season’s Champions League, losing out to Real Madrid in the final. This season, they have been drawn against Serie A runners-up Napoli, Ligue 1 winners PSG and Serbian SuperLiga winners Red Star Belgrade.</p>
<p>Liverpool have played one away match so far, a trip to Naples to take on Napoli, a match in which they lost in the dying minutes thanks to a goal from Lorenzo Insigne. Their fans still have trips to Paris and Belgrade to look forward to.</p>
<p><strong>Tottenham Hotspur</strong></p>
<p>When Spurs fans watched the draw for the Champions League group stage this season, alarm bells began to ring as they were drawn against Barcelona, Inter Milan and PSV Eindhoven.</p>
<p>Having failed to win so far, losing away to Inter Milan and at home to Barcelona and then drawing away to PSV, Tottenham’s hopes of reaching the knockout phase have been severely dented. Although Spurs fans have arguably the easiest away trips with regards to journey times, that will be of little comfort given their current form in Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Manchester United</strong></p>
<p>Jose Mourinho has endured a poor start to his third season in charge of Manchester United. The Red Devils currently lie in 8th place in the Premier League and haven’t fared much better in Europe, winning only one of their opening three Champions League matches, away to BSC Young Boys.</p>
<p>United still have to travel to Valencia and Turin before knowing their final position within the group. These away trips will see the Red Devils face a struggling Valencia and a Juventus team who have former United star Cristiano Ronaldo at their disposal.</p>
<p>The infographic below examines the price the English fans must pay to watch their team away in the Champions League.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There have already been a number of star performers even at this early stage of the premier league season. Chelsea are the surprise package at present as punters continue to use the latest <a href="https://www.us-bookies.com/fanduel-sportsbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offer at fanduel</a> to support them for the title. Can they topple the defending champions Manchester City and the attacking powerhouses of Liverpool? Here we cover some of the stars of the season thus far.</p>
<p><strong>ALISSON &#8211; LIVERPOOL</strong></p>
<p>Liverpool’s keeper, Alisson has been a key addition to the squad. He has made a solid start to the season as the club continue to challenge for the league. At present eight games in, he is one of two keepers to have only conceded three goals. He also sits at the top of the table for saved shot percentage, so can be help them end their wait for another league title.</p>
<p><strong>JOHN STONES – MANCHESTER CITY</strong></p>
<p>It is exciting times for English football as the national team continues to go from strength to strength. They are coming off the back of a starring performance in beating Spain, and one player who is continuing to improve is <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.com/john-stones/profil/spieler/186590" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defender, John Stones</a>. The Manchester City defender is proving a revelation at the back since a stuttering start as pressure piled on him due to his big money move. He sits at the top of the interception, clearance and pass completion charts. He is set to play a leading role in their attempt to defend the premier league title.</p>
<p><strong>JORGINHO &#8211; CHELSEA</strong></p>
<p>He does not do anything flash but the impact he has on the team is unquestionable. He followed Chelsea’s new manager Sarri over from Napoli just showing the esteem he is held in. Chelsea are now renowned for the vast amount of passes they make and this is headed by the Italian. Jorginho continues to control the side from the middle and is all but set to break the premier league passing record unless an injury occurs.</p>
<p><strong>EDEN HAZARD– CHELSEA</strong></p>
<p>Another Chelsea player and the current star of the season is Eden Hazard. He kicked off the current campaign in flying form following a starring role for Belgium at the world cup in Russia. He sits at the top of the scoring charts and he really looks to be excelling from the role he is playing under new manager, Sarri. Hazard is now in talks as a future winner of the Ballon d’or but can he first help lead Chelsea to another premier league title.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All eyes will be on the big fight this weekend as KhabibNurmagomedov and Conor McGregor will be facing off against each other for the Lightweight Championship. The <a href="https://www.paddypower.com/mixed-martial-arts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Khabib McGregor odds</a> suggest that the unbeaten Russian lightweight is the favourite, but it could go either way.</p>
<p>These two fighters might be some of the biggest names in the sport at the moment, but they aren’t the longest serving competitors in the competition. We have taken a look 5 fighters with the longest UFC careers.</p>
<p><strong>Jim Miller – 30 bouts</strong><br />
American fighter Jim Miller currently holds the record for the most UFC bouts, entering the cage 30 times during his career. The UFC lightweight started his professional mixed martial art career in 2005 in the ‘Reality Fighting’ competition, but didn’t join the UFC until July 2008.</p>
<p>His debut came just a few months later at UFC 89. Although Miller was only one of the preliminary matches, his UFC career got off to the best start by defeating David Baron via submission, being awarded the ‘Submission of the Night’ award.</p>
<p>Since making his UFC debut ten years ago, Miller has gone on to make 30 appearances in the cage, winning 18 of them.</p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Stephens – 29 bouts</strong><br />
Like Miller, Jeremy Stephens started his professional mixed martial arts career in 2005, fighting in numerous competitions before joining the UFC in 2007. However, unlike Miller, Stephens’ first fight didn’t go to plan as he was defeated via a second round armbar submission against UFC veteran Din Thomas.</p>
<p>Although the lightweight and featherweight fighter didn’t get off to the best start in the promotion, Stephens has enjoyed a fairly successfully career. In total, Jeremy Stephens has entered the cage 29 times in the past, winning 15 of them.</p>
<p>His defeat to José Aldo put an end to his three-fight winning streak, but leaves him just one fight away from matching Jim Miller’s bout total.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Bisping – 29 bouts</strong><br />
Although Michael Bisping might have announced his retirement from MMA competitions earlier this year, he will be regarded as one of the longest serving competitors in the competition with 29 bouts under his belt. Whilst the majority of UFC fighters usually started their professional career at 18, Bisping started in 2004 at the relatively late age of 25.</p>
<p>Despite the ‘late’ start to his career, Bisping got off to a great start by winning his first 10 fights before being signed by the UFC.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t maintain his unbeaten record throughout his career, his record during his time in the UFC was very respectable, finishing with 20 wins and 9 defeats in 29 matches.</p>
<p><strong>Diego Sanchez – 28 bouts</strong><br />
Since joining the competition in 2005, Sanchez has spent the majority of his career in the UFC and is currently the longest tenured UFC fighter on the active roster. The American has competed in many different fighting divisions over the years, and is currently competing as a ‘lightweight’ and ‘welterweight’.</p>
<p>After spending the first few years of his career in the ‘King of the Cage’ tournaments, Sanchez finally got his ‘break’ with the UFC as he was a participant and winner on the first season of the reality show ‘The Ultimate Fighter’. His victory led to the fighter signing a contract with the UFC and immediately being put in a ‘main card’ fight in his first UFC competition.</p>
<p>From 2005 to 2009, Sanchez was one of the most feared and ‘unstoppable’ fighters in the competition, winning 10 of his first 13 bouts. Although Sanchez has failed to put together a good winning</p>
<p>streak in the past few years, his is still considered one of the best competitors in the UFC.</p>
<p>In total, Sanchez has been involved with the UFC for 4,926 days (as of 03/10/2018) – the longest out of any active UFC fighter.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Mir – 27 bouts</strong><br />
Although Diego Sanchez is currently the longest tenured active fighter, Frank Mir held that title before his <a href="https://mmajunkie.com/2017/07/frank-mir-ufc-heavyweight-champion-release" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release from the UFC in 2016</a> with 5,557 continuous days with the UFC from 2nd November 2001 until 20th March 2016.</p>
<p>From a young age, Mir showed huge potential in wrestling and martial arts and was soon signed up to the UFC in 2001 following two wins in other MMA competitions. Throughout the majority of his time in the UFC, Mir won most of his fights by knockout or submission, only relying on the judges’ decision twice. In the later years of his time with the UFC, Mir experienced more defeats than wins. Despite this, Mir has gone down as a legend in the competition.</p>
<p>The “biggest fight in UFC history” is set to take place this Saturday at the T-Mobile Arena in Vegas. Although it’s the first time that the two will be fighting against each other, the two fighters have a history with one another which has turned from respect into a full blown rivalry.</p>
<p>Considering that Khabib hasn’t experienced a single defeat in his professional career and McGregor hasn’t entered the cage in two years, it seems that a Khabib win is the most likely outcome. However, McGregor is a very difficult fighter and will want to put an end to his rivals’ unbeaten record.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Ultimate Fighting Championship will host one of the most anticipated fights in the women’s division, as two champions go face-to-face with each other in what will be anything but atypical fight.</p>
<p>On December 29th, UFC 232 will see the Women’s Bantamweight champion, Amanda Nunes, take on Cris Cyborg, the current Women’s Featherweight champion. The pair have exchanged barbs on social media, in particular, with regards to the date of their fight.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Since <a href="https://twitter.com/Amanda_Leoa?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Amanda_Leoa</a> wants me to sit 10 months without fighting&#8230; any Featherweights willing to fight <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ufc228?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ufc228</a>? Nunes last fight only sold 85k ppv &#8230;.I’m not counting on much help from her to reach that $2.50 ppv bonus. <a href="https://t.co/sHHjqQdIRB">https://t.co/sHHjqQdIRB</a></p>
<p>— CyborgVNunes #UFC232 (@criscyborg) <a href="https://twitter.com/criscyborg/status/1017231930213842944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 12, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script><br />
The odds suggest that Cris Cyborg is the most likely to end up as the victor, being priced at 3/10. But can Nunes upset the odds and defeat one of the most dominant women the UFC has ever seen?</p>
<p><strong>The Build-Up</strong></p>
<p>Cyborg was hoping to have the fight in September, so as to avoid a substantial amount of time since last having a competitive fight in the Octagon. However, Nunes’ camp said the Bantamweight champion wouldn’t be ready for the UFC 228 pay-per-view in September and instead a picture was posted of Nunes signing a contract for the fight to take place at UFC 232 on December 29th in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>Talk of the fight began earlier this year as Nunes and her camp called for the match to take place. Cyborg was more than willing to accept the challenge, but has become frustrated at having to wait nearly 10 months to fight again, having defeated Yana Kunitskaya in March.</p>
<p>When the two finally collide inside the Octagon, it will be an historic fight, as the winner will become the first woman to hold two championships at the same time, something that has only been achieved in the UFC twice overall, with Conor McGregor and Daniel Cormier having achieved the feat in the men’s divisions.</p>
<p>Conor McGregor takes on Khabib Nurmagomedov at the UFC 229 pay-per-view and the <a href="https://www.paddypower.com/mixed-martial-arts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Khabib vs McGregor odds</a> are in favour of the undefeated Russian, with Khabib at 4/7 to win.</p>
<p><strong>Amanda Nunes</strong></p>
<p>Nunes, from the Bahia region of Brazil, is currently undefeated in her last 7 professional fights. She last tasted defeat back in September 2014 at the hands of Cat Zingano. Her current record in the UFC is nine wins and one loss.</p>
<p>She captured the UFC Women’s Bantamweight championship in July 2016 after defeating Miesha Tate via submission at UFC 200. She has since successfully defended her championship on three occasions against Ronda Rousey, Valentina Shevchenko and Raquel Pennington.</p>
<p>Despite her success in the UFC, it will be interesting to see how Nunes fares in moving up a weight class. Could it be that she loses some of her speed, creating an opening for Cyborg to pounce with her precise striking ability?</p>
<p><strong>Cris Cyborg</strong></p>
<p>Cyborg, whose real name is Cristiane Justino Venancio, has not lost since opening her professional account with a defeat against Erica Paes in 2005. However, she has since remained undefeated and is currently 5-0 in the UFC. Much like her opponent, Cyborg hails from Brazil and there has been speculation that this could be her <a href="https://www.mmafighting.com/2018/7/15/17571566/cris-cyborg-amanda-nunes-will-be-last-fight-ufc-mma" target="_blank" rel="noopener">final fight in the UFC</a>.</p>
<p>It was in July 2017 that Cyborg won the vacant UFC Women’s Featherweight championship, defeating Tonya Evinger via technical knockout in the third round. She has since successfully defended it against Yana Kunitskaya and Holly Holm, the latter of whom famously beat the previously undefeated Ronda Rousey.</p>

When her contract expires in March 2019, Cyborg has stated that she wishes to make the <a href="https://mmajunkie.com/2018/05/ufc-champ-cris-cyborg-move-mma-to-boxing-cecilia-braekhus" target="_blank" rel="noopener">move over to boxing</a>, something she has long desired to do. Boxing is a part of her style, along with muay thai, Brazilian jiu-jitsu and wrestling, all of which make her a fierce competitor inside the Octagon.</p>
<p><strong>Prediction</strong></p>
<p>This fight will no doubt be a close call, as both women have proven themselves in their respective weight classes.</p>
<p>Cyborg’s striking ability could be the difference between victory and defeat for the Featherweight champion, while Nunes should look to takedown her opponent and try to strike her while in a prone position.</p>
<p>A submission victory is unlikely, with the pair of Brazilians preferring to instead try for the knockout victory.<br />
With Cyborg having the size advantage as well as being used to competing at the 145lb weight, our prediction is for Cyborg to defeat Nunes via knockout.</p>
