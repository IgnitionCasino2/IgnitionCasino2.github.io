										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Diogo Jota was one of the key players in Wolverhampton Wanderers’ impressive Championship promotion campaign last time out, and now the Portuguese youngster will have his sights set on lighting up the Premier League. The former Atletico Madrid man will be crucial in the years to come for Nuno Espirito Santo’s side, and if he can get off to a flying start in the top flight there is no telling how far this team can go.</p>
<p>The progress made at Wolves in the last year is astounding, and the Midlands club have completed some impressive player swoops thanks to their links with super-agent Jorge Mendes. Nuno’s side are a club on the rise, and this is highlighted by the fact that the newly promoted Championship winners aren’t even considered among the favourites for relegation in the season ahead. In fact, at the time of writing, with <a href="http://sports.williamhill.com/bet/en-gb/betting/y/5/Football.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all football odds</a> they can be backed at 9/1 to finish in the top six.</p>
<p>Wolves are expected to do well upon their return to the top flight due to the fact that they have some young stars in their ranks, such as Ruben Neves and Jota. Jota was the club’s top scorer last season, with 17 goals and 5 assists during his loan spell at the Molineux Stadium. Wolves were quick to make the deal <a href="http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11699/11229101/wolves-to-sign-diogo-jota-on-permanent-deal-from-atletico-madrid-at-end-of-season" target="_blank" rel="noopener">permanent</a> this summer, and it could turn out to be an incredible bit of business.<br />
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VoMtK314Rj4" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><br />
Jota began his senior career at Pacos Ferreira, where he scored 14 goals in 41 league appearances. This attracted the interest of La Liga giants Atletico, but the youngster was immediately loaned out to Porto upon his arrival at the Estadio Vicente Calderon. It was during his time with the Portuguese heavyweights that Jota began to make a name for himself as a potential future star.</p>
<p>At only 21 years old, Wolves have acquired Jota at the perfect time and can mould him into a dangerous weapon in the English top flight. The newly promoted side spent around £12 million on the winger, but this could turn out to be a bargain in today’s market. In fact, if he continues on this trajectory the Portuguese U23 international could be worth triple that in a couple of years.<br />
While Jota was one of the standout names in the lower tier last season, it isn’t always easy for players to make the step up to the top flight. Players like <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/05/18/footballs-inbetweeners-players-good-championship-cant-cut-premier/dwight-gayle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dwight Gayle</a> and Matt Ritchie have been dominant forces in the Championship in the past, but have never quite had the same effect in the Premier League. However, some do succeed. Charlie Adam and Rickie Lambert are two examples of players who managed to bring their second-tier form into the top division.</p>
<p>Wolves have a fairly tough start to their return to the Premier League and will face Everton, Leicester City, and Manchester City in their first three fixtures. In these games, Wolves may be forced to sit back and defend, but Jota could be deadly on the break. If the Portuguese can play his football against these teams, he could easily start his journey towards becoming a top-flight star.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After an impressive 2016/17 season, Manchester United took a step backwards under Jose Mourinho last campaign. The Red Devils fell short in their pursuit of silverware and fans were critical of Mourinho’s style of play. United started the season like a house on fire but their form tailed off midway through the campaign and Mourinho is now under pressure to deliver ahead of the 2018/19 Premier League season.</p>
<p>On paper, it was an ‘almost’ kind of year for United. Second to an unstoppable Manchester City side in the Premier League title race, the Red Devils secured their highest finish since lifting the title in 2013. In terms of results, there was progression but <a href="http://www.skysports.com/football/news/15115/11298831/measuring-manchester-uniteds-progress-under-jose-mourinho" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mourinho’s decision to opt for substance over style</a> did not sit well with the Old Trafford faithful. Supporters pay good money to be entertained and United were underwhelming on the whole.</p>

<p>— Steve Bates (@sbates_people) <a href="https://twitter.com/sbates_people/status/998532340220612608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 21, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>United fans were angry at the manner of their Champions League last-16 defeat to Sevilla; the Red Devils were in the ascendency at Old Trafford before Mourinho attempted to shut up shop and defend a slender lead. That decision backfired as the Spanish outfit scored two quickfire goals – United suffered yet another embarrassing result on home soil. We’re not even going to talk about that FA Cup final defeat to Chelsea either…</p>
<p>Those failures have only heightened the expectations at Old Trafford ahead of 2018/19. Mourinho knows that silverware is an absolute must and the Premier League title will be United’s primary target next season – as is the case at the start of every season. As of July 2nd, <a href="https://extra.bet365.com/news/en/football/premier-league" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Red Devils are 6/1 in Premier League betting odds</a> and plenty of punters will be piling on United ahead of what could be a memorable year for the club.</p>
<p>Acting quickly in the transfer window can be the difference between success and failure – and United moved effectively to acquire Brazil midfielder Fred prior to the World Cup 2018. The former Shakhtar Donetsk star is a naturally gifted, box-to-box midfielder and his impact and influence will open up space for Paul Pogba. Fred looks destined to shine at Old Trafford and fans will be expecting big things ahead of his debut in August.<br />
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jSPAwG6IQKg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Mourinho’s treatment of Anthony Martial angered supporters and fans will be hoping that the Frenchman is given a fair chance this year. According to WhoScored, Martial appeared in 30 Premier League matches last season; <a href="https://www.whoscored.com/Players/122366/Show/Anthony-Martial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">although 12 of those were from the substitute’s bench</a>. In those games, the Frenchman scored nine goals whilst assisting five for his peers – some ratio considering his lack of regular time on the pitch.</p>
<p>Jose Mourinho needs to win over his critics and a Premier League title triumph is the best way to do that. Overturning the 19-point deficit to arch rivals Manchester City will be tough but United have the tools to lay down a serious challenge to Pep Guardiola’s side. With a couple of new signings before the end of the transfer window, United could be primed to regain their place at the summit of English football.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following a disappointing exit at the 2018 World Cup held in Russia, Joachim Low will still be retaining his post as Germany&#8217;s manager despite his team eviction at the group stage.</p>
<p>With strong rumours linking the Die Mannschaft&#8217;s manager to the Premier League also claiming Low is on the verge of being replaced this summer.</p>
<p>However, with latest media conference the German FA (DFB) will be keeping their manager who helped them to World Cup victory four years ago, after seeing him as the current best manager to reform the Die Mannschaft team for another World Cup to qualify for.</p>
<p>The German FA releases a statement via their <a href="https://twitter.com/DFB_Team_EN/status/1014118068166029313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1014118068166029313&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.skysports.com%2Ffootball%2Fnews%2F12023%2F11424729%2Fjoachim-low-to-remain-germany-head-coach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter account</a>: &#8220;Joachim #Löw will continue as #DieMannschaft head coach&#8221;</p>
<p>The statement confirms that the German manager will be managing the Die Mannschaft till the end of newly signed contract which is set to expire in the summer of 2022 &#8211; when Qatar will be hosting the next World Cup.</p>
<p>Low said: “I feel, in spite of the legitimate criticism of our departure, generally much support and encouragement.<br />
zz<br />
“But now I want to design the rebuilding with full commitment. It all takes time, but everything will happen in time for the start of the new international season in September.”</p>
<p>With that being said, National team director Oliver Bierhoff also added his, saying via <a href="http://www.skysports.com/football/news/12023/11424729/joachim-low-to-remain-germany-head-coach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sky Sports</a>: “I am very pleased that Jogi Löw is at the helm of our national team and we sat together for a long time yesterday and I felt the full energy to continue.</p>
<p>“After 14 years of successful work, we now have to rebuild and we will now be thinking about it and about further structural changes.”</p>
<p>The Germany national team suffered their first catastrophic eviction away from the biggest football tournament in Russia, being eliminated from the group stage for the first time since 1938. Experts in the field of <a href="https://footballpredictions.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">football predictions</a> didn’t expect Germany to fail this hard: They ended their World Cup campaign at the bottom of the Group F.</p>
<p>Succumbing to their first defeat of the tournament to Mexico in a 1-0 win to the El Tri, but immediately found their feet in their next game against Sweden which they won 2-1 and a 2-0 loss to South Korea all but secured their return to Germany.</p>
<p>With some spectator claiming the Die Mannschaft return to Germany was not the Joachim Low&#8217;s failing tactics fault. Low has guided his National side to the semi-finals of every major tournament since his appointment as manager in 2006, which result to 2014 World Cup and 2017 European Championship glory.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Interesting Facts About Football</p>
<p>As the World Cup unfolds in Russia, there are many people around the world who have started carefully planning their days around the various match timetables. Football is, as well all know, the single most popular sport on earth, so this should come as no surprise.</p>
<p>While the players thrill you with goals, kicks, upsets, and more, this article will help you pass the time between games, and fill you in on some lesser-known facts about The Beautiful Game.</p>
<p>● Football is a very old game. It originated in China, around 476 B.C.</p>
<p>● It the most played, and the most watched, sport on the planet.</p>
<p>● It is the world’s most popular sport, with more than a billion people tuning in to view the matches on TV.</p>
<p>Quite a few of these will be punters enjoying a little added action thanks to the<br />
markets that <a href="https://onlinebetting.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sports betting NZ</a> and many other countries are providing.</p>
<p>● The largest football tournament ever saw a grand total of 5 098 teams take place. They all competed in 1999, in the second Bangkok League Seven-a-Side Contest. There were over 35 000 players on the field at one point or another!</p>
<p>● The most goals ever scored by a single player in one game was 16. Stephan Stanis, of France, was the man responsible, and he accomplished this feat in December of 1942, when he appeared for Racing Club de Lens.</p>
<p>● Video evidence has proven that the fastest-ever goal scored was a 2.8 second shot by Uruguay’s Ricardo Olivera, in a game in December of 1998.</p>
<p>● Goalkeepers did not have to wear shirts coloured differently to that of their teammates until 1913.</p>
<p>● The average distance players cover during a game is 9.65 kilometers, or 5.9 miles.</p>
<p>● The first basketball game to ever be played used a soccer ball!</p>
<p>● The first Football Club in the World was the English Sheffield Football Club. It was established in 1857 by Colonel Nathaniel Creswick and Major William Priest, two officers in the British Army.</p>
<p>● Teams <a href="https://tinboxchina.com/europe-travel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Europe</a> have managed to reach every World Cup Final, with the exception of those which took place in 1930 and 1950.</p>
<p>● The highest-ever scoring game was clocked in at 149 &#8211; 0. Stade Olympique de L’emyrne, a Malagasy squad, were scoring own goals as protest for an unfair decision that a ref had made in the game preceding it.</p>
<p>● Nigerian-born Chelsea player Celestine Babayaro injured his legs as he celebrated his first goal in a pre-season game, and Luigi Riva, of Italy, made a shot so powerful that he actually broke a spectator’s arm.</p>
<p>● The first-ever black football player was a Mr Arthur Wharton, back in the 1800s.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cesc Fabregas. Dani Parejo. Juan Mata. Ander Herrera. Pedro Rodriguez. Javi Martinez. Marcos Alonso. Hector Bellerin. Sergi Roberto. All names that any manager would love to have in their lineup, but names not even good enough to make Spain’s 23. Despite all their midfield and defense riches, Spain’s attack tells a different story. The 2010 winners are currently the 3rd favourites in <a href="https://www.betfair.com/exchange/plus/football/competition/5614746" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World cup 2018 odds</a> to win it for only the second time in their history.</p>
<p>Even in the Fernando Torres-David Villa peak days of yore, attack was perhaps never Spain’s strongest suit. It showed &#8211; even in their victorious 2010 World Cup campaign, Spain only scored more than 1 goal in just 2 games &#8211; and won all their knockout matches by the same score, 1-0. But it was different back then &#8211; their USP &#8211; a midfield full of all-time legends in Sergio Busquets, Andres Iniesta and Xavi Hernandez, knew that they could take their time on the ball, patiently break teams down through their patented style of play, tiki-taka, and when the chance came, a world-class striker would be there to bury it.<br />
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aKSHgMqCwbQ?start=170" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><br />
But as Torres and Villa declined, Spain moved on. Necessity is the mother of innovation, as the saying goes. Vincent del Bosque trialled a striker-less 4-6-0 formation at Euro 2012, with a front 3 of David Silva, Fabregas and Iniesta &#8211; all 3 central midfielders by trade. Fabregas would be the central of the 3, and the La Roja’s furthest forward player. The term “false 9” was popularized. Despite the flak del Bosque copped, it worked. Spain did not create many chances in the final third, played “boring” football, focused on keeping the ball than creating chances &#8211; yet they emerged comfortable winners, blitzing Italy 4-0 in the final.</p>
<p>Another major tournament saw another major change &#8211; as the 2014 World Cup rolled by, Spain again saw a change of guard in attack. Brazilian-born Diego Costa, previously snubbed by his nation of birth, obtained Spanish citizenship in the build-up to the tournament. Costa had had a sensational season in 2013-14 &#8211; his 27 league goals in 35 appearances not only gave Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo a run for their money in the Pichichi rankings, but also led Atletico Madrid to a sensational league title victory &#8211; ending the Barcelona-Real Madrid duopoly, and as far as a heartbreaking extra time defeat in the Champions League final to cross-town rivals Real.</p>
<p>But it didn’t work out &#8211; champions Spain were dumped out in the group stage, after just 2 games. They were thumped 5-1 by an unfancied Netherlands before suffering a 2-0 defeat at the hands of Chile. Spain only scored 4 goals in the tournament, 3 of them coming in a dead rubber against group minnows Australia. Ironically, Costa ended the tournament goalless, while the old guard, Villa and Torres both notched a goal each in the final game. For a side that tailored their style of play around short passes, a true, traditional, big and strong #9 in Costa did not quite work out well, as he was continuously booed by the Brazilian crowd, who thought that he had “betrayed” his birthplace. The Brazilian crowd joyously celebrated as Costa missed a sitter against Chile –the match that saw Spain eliminated from the tournament.</p>
<p>Yet another big tournament, yet another striker. After a torrid 15-16 season with Chelsea, Costa was dropped from the Euro 2016 squad. Alvaro Morata, who had a fruitful Champions League for Juventus, but yet used sparingly in the league, and 35-year-old AritzAduriz were preferred. Morata scored 3 goals in the group stages, but failed to have any impact in the knockout stage as Spain were eliminated after a 2-0 defeat to Italy in the Round of 16.</p>
<p>Two years later, their seemingly eternal striker dilemma seems to have come full circle. Spain have gone back to Costa, with Morata dropped. The previous incumbent, Morata, had a torrid domestic season with Chelsea &#8211; the exact position Costa found himself in, 2 years ago, after replacing him at Stamford Bridge this season. Chelsea’s club record signing at £60m,Morata couldn’t have asked for the season he had at a worse time &#8211; scoring only 11 league goals, missing a whopping 17 big chances throughout the season, and going a period of 3 months goalless at a stretch.</p>
<p>Costa, himself, hasn’t had much of a fruitful season either. Frozen out by Chelsea despite a successful 16-17 season where he powered the London club to a league title, he was sold back to Atletico Madrid. Atletico, facing a transfer ban, could not register him until January &#8211; so Costa went 6 months without top level football. Naturally rusty on return, he could only muster 3 league goals in 15 appearances. Spain’s joint-top scorer in the qualifying (with Morata), Julian Lopetegui put his faith in him again, but it remains to be seen if he can deliver on the biggest stage of all with very little football and poor form behind him.</p>

The other forwards called up, Iago Aspas, Rodrigo and Lucas Vazquez have all had respectable seasons domestically, but they are not forwards of the pedigree that will make defenders shudder in their boots &#8211; no one is quite yet established in the top tier, like Villa and Torres were back in 2010. Sergio Busquets, Andres Iniesta, Isco, Marco Asensio, David Silva, Thiago Alcantara, Koke, Saul Niguez &#8211; it reads like a who’s who of the top midfielders of today, but for Spain to have a productive World Cup, this service needs to be converted by the men upfront. It remains to be seen how Lopetegui utilizes this crop of midfielders, with the famine of a harvest up top.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the World Cup squads having been announced in recent days by all participating nations, the excitement levels are going through the roof. The previous World Cup in Brazil saw many surprises, none more so than the host nation being embarrassed 7-1 by the Germans in the semi-final. The Germans went on to win the trophy against Argentina in extra time, in what turned out to be the most expensive football match ever in terms of ticket prices, <a href="https://www.sbo.net/golden-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with some going for as much as $20,000 a seat</a>. We have taken a look some of the other fun World Cup facts:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3596 size-full" src="http://www.onlinesportson.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/world-cup-russia.jpg" alt="world cup russia" width="640" height="426" srcset="http://www.onlinesportson.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/world-cup-russia.jpg 640w, http://www.onlinesportson.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/world-cup-russia-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><strong>Stadium Distances</strong><br />
Unlike other sporting tournaments like the Olympics, the World Cup is evenly spread throughout a nation. Four years ago in Brazil, there were twelve different stadiums with distances as much as 2,000 miles between them. The journey from Porto Alegre to Fortaleza would have taken over 5 hours one way. Similarly, in Russia, the distance between Yekaterinburg in the east and Kaliningrad in the west is roughly the same distance as London to Moscow!</p>
<p><strong>3.2 Billion Viewers</strong><br />
At the last World Cup in Brazil, a truly incredibly statistic was revealed, which was that almost half of the world’s entire population tuned in to watch the event. When you consider that Brazil is widely regarded as the greatest nation to ever play the beautiful game, then it’s easy to see why. Add to that the golden generation of stars such as Messi and Ronaldo at the peak of their powers, and an England team that somehow always manages to break our hearts!</p>
<p><strong>Baby Booms</strong><br />
It has often been said that the countries that win a World Cup often experience a baby boom in the coming months. This has been noted for numerous countries who have had success in tournaments such as the French in 1998 and the Spanish in 2010. It’s even happened for countries that didn’t even win a tournament, but exceeded expectations. Nine months after Iceland’s stunning victory against England in Euro 2016, hospitals all over the Scandinavian country were suddenly more inhabited than ever before!</p>
<p><strong>3 Million Beers</strong><br />
At the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, a grand total of 750,000 litres of beer were sold at the stadiums, equating to roughly 3 million beers in total. While you may be thinking that’s one hell of a collective hangover in the morning, 390,600 hot dogs were also sold, which must have taken the edge off somewhat!</p>
<p><strong>European Dominance</strong><br />
Out of all the World Cup finals ever played, European teams have only failed to reach the final twice. European nations have won 58.8% of the finals matches that they’ve played in, and it is the Italians and the Germans who are the dominant teams on the continent with 4 titles each to their name and only 1 behind Brazil.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The World Cup is now less than a month away, and with squad announcements filtering in, the excitement surrounding the event just went up a notch.</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps the one fact which makes this tournament unique is that it is being played across four time zones. With eleven time zones in Russia, this World Cup could have been absolute hell for some. Fortunately, the action will be largely restricted to European Russia, but there is still a challenge for tournament coordinators.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3600" src="http://www.onlinesportson.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/world-cup-russia-2.jpg" alt="world cup russia 2018" width="640" height="426" srcset="http://www.onlinesportson.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/world-cup-russia-2.jpg 640w, http://www.onlinesportson.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/world-cup-russia-2-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p>With nearly 2,000 miles separating the furthest west (Kaliningrad) and the furthest east (Yekaterinburg) stadiums, this tournament promises to show exactly how much logistical muscle FIFA now has.</p>
<p>In addition to the issue of time zones, there are four more talking points ahead of Russia.</p>
<p><strong>Enter Iceland and Panama</strong></p>
<p>There are two nations making a World Cup debut: Iceland and Panama. Yet, debuting teams seldom have as much expectation surrounding them as the Iceland squad does. Years of investment into Icelandic football, materialised by the presence of indoor training academies, finally paid off in 2016 with a run to the Euro 2016 quarter-finals. The Iceland team remained strong thereafter, and <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup-qualifying-european/table" target="_blank" rel="noopener">progressed as winners</a> from their qualification group for the World Cup.</p>
<p>By contrast, Panama carries nothing in the way of expectation, and the squad contains no players with notable playing experience in the UEFA Champions League. Regardless, the history of the World Cup is awash with debutants that stunned. In the two World Cups of the 2000s, Senegal and Ghana both negotiated the group stages on their respective debuts. Going further back, another Central American nation did the same in 1990, with Costa Rica progressing after beating a strong Sweden side 2-1.</p>
<p><strong>Exit the veterans</strong></p>
<p>For England, Gary Cahill, Ashley Young and Jamie Vardy will be making their final appearance at a World Cup final. All are now in their thirties, but boast the type of experience that can galvanise younger players like Trent Alexander-Arnold and Ruben Loftus-Cheek.</p>
<p>There are also some well-known players within other teams, who have endeared themselves to Englanders through club-level heroics, and all of them will know that this summer’s tournament represents their World Cup swansong. Belgian thirty-something duo Vincent Kompany (Manchester City) and Thomas Vermaelen (Tottenham) have been exceptional in defence for their respective clubs, and will certainly give Jamie Vardy a tough time, in the game that <a href="https://www.sportingindex.com/spread-betting/football/international-world-cup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the World Cup spreads suggest</a> will determine the winners of Group G.</p>
<p>Of course, there is one superstar who will be more eager than anybody else to win the World Cup on what must be his last attempt. Alongside a Lionel Messi who could still be game for 2022, Cristiano Ronaldo has been one of the most electrifying athletes of his generation. Without his influence, Portugal could never have won Euro 2016, and at the age of 33, it is now or never for ‘#CR7’ to take the big one.</p>
<p><strong>A poisoned chalice?</strong></p>
<p>The last two World Cups have seen the reigning holders bow out at the group stage. 2014 saw Spain lose 5-1 to the Netherlands in a re-run of the 2010 final. It was a seismic result that propelled the Dutch all the way to the semi finals, but the tables have since turned again, with the Netherlands failing to qualify and Spain rampaging to top spot in the qualifiers.</p>
<p>In 2010, Italy fared even worse in their own cup defence, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jun/24/italy-slovakia-world-cup-match-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">finishing last</a> in a group containing an unfancied New Zealand side. Indeed, only Brazil’s negotiation of the group stage in 2006 prevented this apparent ‘curse’ from being given an even deeper context. France’s bottom-placed finish in the 2002 group stages is also an infamous example of how far a defending champion can fall.</p>
<p><strong>Up for grabs?</strong></p>
<p>There is better news, however, for ‘seeded’ teams – or teams drawn from pot 1. Since 1990, every cup-winning nation has been drawn from pot 1. Argentina is the last nation to defy the odds in that respect, doing so via Diego Maradona’s heroics in 1986. Additionally, no team qualifying from the CONCACAF (North American), CAF (African), AFC (Asian) or OFC (Oceanic) regions has ever won the cup.</p>
<p>Speaking of trophies, the ‘golden boot’ carries a curse of its own, in that no player has won it alongside a World Cup winner’s medal since 1982. Paolo Rossi remains the last man to pull off a personal ‘double’, but no man has ever managed to win it twice in a row. For that reason, James Rodriguez will be a particular person of interest this summer, having taken it in 2014 with six goals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>European football’s night of nights is upon us once again as we get ready to watch Liverpool and Real Madrid battle it out in the Champions League final. It promises to be a spectacular event with both teams having an extremely successful history in the competition. The match will be played in Kiev, Ukraine, at the NSC Olimpiyskiy Stadium in front of a fully packed house of 70,000 fans.</p>
<p>Real have won the tournament a record 12 times and are the reigning champs after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jun/03/juventus-real-madrid-champions-league-final-match-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defeating Italian side Juventus 4-1</a> in Cardiff last year. It was the first time a club had won consecutive titles and their third Champions League title in four years.</p>
<p>Liverpool also have a rich history in the league, having won five titles with the last being back in 2005 against AC Milan. The Reds came back from a 3-0 deficit at half-time to stun the Italian giants and push the game to penalties. Some superb goalkeeping from Jerzy Dudek and a cool head from Liverpool’s penalty takers ensured that the coveted trophy returned back to Anfield once again.</p>
<p>This year’s final is expected to be a high scoring affair with Liverpool being the competition’s highest-scoring side with 40, and Madrid in second on 30. The Spanish giants will go into the match as favourites at 6/5 though, with the Reds currently 21/10 according to <a href="http://sports.williamhill.com/bet/en-gb/betting/t/344/UEFA Champions League.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this link</a> at William Hill’s betting website.</p>
<p>The tournament’s all-time leading goal scorer, Cristiano Ronaldo, is the bookmakers&#8217; choice to draw first blood at 3/1, and will be a major attacking threat for Real having scored 15 goals already in the competition. The Portuguese superstar is not only magnificent during normal play, but has one of the most lethal boots in world football when it comes to free kicks. The key for the English side will be to shut Ronaldo out of the game as much as possible, forcing Madrid to use their other attacking options instead.</p>
<p>Liverpool however, have a much more even spread when it comes to their key forwards, with the fantastic trio of Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane tearing apart team’s defences on their way to the final. Salah and Firmino lead the way for the English side with an impressive ten goals apiece, with Mane right behind them scoring nine.</p>
<p>Although Liverpool are the underdogs heading into the match, the ability to score goals from a range of different positions is sure to cause a few headaches for the Madrid defence. Their midfield has also played a large part in the journey to Kiev, with James Milner leading the competition for assists with nine.</p>
<p>Stopping Ronaldo is the key if the Reds have any chance of lifting the trophy and it looks like they may have had some help from Liverpool’s football gods. Cristiano picked up an ankle injury in the recent 2-2 Classico draw against fierce rivals Barcelona, and some football experts think it <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/701740/Cristiano-Ronaldo-injury-latest-Real-Madrid-Liverpool-news-Champions-League-final" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may be more serious</a> than the club is letting on. Madrid will feel that they have to start him but it could prove costly if he aggravates the injury and needs to be substituted. It would surely open the game wide open and Liverpool’s offensive style could see the momentum shift the English side’s way.</p>
<p>Will the Spanish side continue its dominance in Europe or are the glory days about to return to Anfield? In a few short weeks, we will have the answer to the question on every football fan’s lips. It’s going to be a sensational night of football as spectators from all over the world tune in to see who will be crowned the champions of Europe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Champions League reaches the semi-finals stage this week, with two mouth-watering ties scheduled to be played on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
<p>Liverpool and Roma go head-to-head in the first leg of their tie on Tuesday, while Bayern Munich and Real Madrid meet the following day. The return legs are set to take place on May 1 &amp; 2.</p>
<p>Read on as we preview both semi-final ties.</p>
<p><strong>Liverpool vs Roma</strong></p>
<p>Liverpool haven&#8217;t won the Champions League since 2005, but their quarter-final victory over <a href="http://www.onlinesportson.net/assessing-manchester-citys-champions-league-assault.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly-fancied Manchester City</a> raised hopes that they could end that barren run.</p>
<p>However, Roma&#8217;s second leg performance against Barcelona in the previous round showed that it would be foolish to underestimate them.</p>
<p>The Serie A side were beaten 4-1 by Barcelona in the first leg of their quarter-final tie, but they battled back in the return game to win 3-0 and progress to the last four on away goals.</p>
<p>The Reds are priced at 2/5 with <a href="http://www.xn--q3cb0a2acc6bd4m.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bet365</a> to qualify for the final, with Roma available at 7/4.</p>
<p>Liverpool comfortably progressed through the group stages without losing a game, and they have seen off both Porto and Man City in the knockout rounds.</p>
<p>Roma finished top of their group above Chelsea and Atletico Madrid in the first stage and their subsequent victories over Shakhtar Donetsk and Barca will give them confidence that they can defeat Liverpool.</p>
<p>Mohamed Salah continued his superb form for Liverpool with his 41st goal of the season at West Bromwich Albion in the Premier League on Saturday and he is priced at 11/5 to score two or more goals on Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>Bayern Munich vs Real Madrid</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://fcbayern.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bayern Munich</a> face holders Real Madrid in the last four of the Champions League aiming to reach the final for the first time since 2013.</p>
<p>Bayern booked their place in the semi-finals with a 2-1 aggregate success against Sevilla, while Real needed Cristiano Ronaldo&#8217;s last minute penalty to see off Juventus 4-3 overall.</p>
<p>The German club are priced at Evens to progress to the final, with Madrid on offer at 3/4.</p>
