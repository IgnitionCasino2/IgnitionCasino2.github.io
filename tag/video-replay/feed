										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <strong>video replay</strong> one of the most discussed topic in <strong>football </strong>in the recent years.</p>
<p>Everyone expects from the referees to be perfect, or at least to reduce the mistakes during the games but it looks that this is a very hard task to do. So everyone tries to find solutions, and <em>Fifa </em>is pressed from all sides to come with an alternative.</p>
<p>In the first phase <em>Fifa </em>tried the system with 6 referees, tested it in Europa League, but even this solution doesn&#8217;t seem to be better. There were also speculations that the ball should contain a chip to signal when the ball passes the line of the goal but the solutions is not well seen by the specialists.</p>
<p>So at the moment it looks like the only viable solution is the video replay.Regarding the video replay the opinions are divided with a plus for it. Fifa is pressed to take a decision especially after the World Cup mistakes, when some of them proved to be crucial.</p>
<p>So after rugby, basketball, tennis or american football we might have video replays also in <strong>football</strong>. This decision would bring advantages but not only.</p>
<p>At advantages we can mention fewer mistakes that can decide games and  fewer scandals. On the other side the spirit and the charm of the game  would suffer.  Imagine for example a game show with a similar setup &#8211; a Who Wants To Be Millionaire Online Game for example would take so long and become boring. Also the game could have more than 10 minutes of  additional time which could determine the players to lose their  patience  awaiting for the verdict, the fluidity of the game could also  suffer.</p>
<p>The final decision will be taken in November but there are chances for a positive answer.</p>
