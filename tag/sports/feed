										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Every year the NBA draft is followed by millions of eager basketball fans around the world, as the most promising international and college prospects are chosen. The first picks typically go to the worst teams from the previous season, within a system that is aimed at making the NBA competitive. Nevertheless, it’s also a system with some glaring flaws, which includes encouraging teams to underperform and tank, in order to get better picks.</p>



<p>Perhaps the best example of a team tanking during the 2019-20 season is the Golden State Warriors. This is the same franchise which has dominated the NBA in recent years, reaching five consecutive NBA Finals since 2015 and winning the championship three times. Now they are completely unrecognizable, rock-bottom of the Western Conference and the first team to be mathematically eliminated from playoff contention.</p>



<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aZ5n0pPX5wU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>The Milwaukee Bucks convincingly top the Eastern Conference and the Los Angeles Lakers dominate in the Western Conference, with both tipped as favorites to reach the Finals prior to the enforced break, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://extra.bet365.com/news/en/US-Sports/NBA" target="_blank">according to the NBA betting on bet365</a>, yet casual observers are unable to understand why the Golden State Warriors aren’t up there competing with them. The answer is quite simple – the Warriors are tanking to ensure they get better draft options.</p>



<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WlvU4XlGQy4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>In the world of competitive professional sports, it might be hard to comprehend a situation whereby losing can be regarded as ultimately more rewarding than winning. However, this is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://allthingsnba.news.blog/2019/03/23/the-nba-draft-lottery-paradox/" target="_blank">the paradox created by the NBA draft system</a>. The aim of the draft is noble, for sure, because it gives the worst teams each season a chance to improve.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, it also creates a situation whereby franchises can exploit that noble aim. Since the introduction of the NBA draft Lottery, the odds are stacked heavily in favor of the worst teams for the first four picks. This means they will get the best new players entering the NBA. Ahead of the next NBA draft, the Golden State Warriors are the worst team in either conference, which means they have the joint-best odds of landing the highest-ranked players.</p>



<p>As this <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1160424-golden-state-warriors-why-the-warriors-tanking-is-hurting-the-nba" target="_blank">2012 article published by Bleacher Report highlights</a>, it’s not the first time the Warriors have looked ahead to the draft, rather than focus on winning. Back then, the way they concluded the season was called into question, apparently valuing better draft options above the prestige of competing to finish higher in the league rankings. 2019-20 results have been so bad, it seems like the Warriors are taking the same approach to a new extreme.</p>



<p>In some regards, this has created a race to the bottom where GM’s value first picks in the draft, along with the chance to sign a potential All-Star player, ahead of team performance during a season that isn’t going so well. For this reason alone, it’s clear that the draft system needs to be constantly reviewed and revised.</p>



<p>Some have suggested a completely open lottery, with no preferential order amongst teams in the draft system based around conference positions from the previous season. Perhaps this approach would discourage teams from tanking, and restore the purity of competition to the NBA, with teams aiming to perform within the best of their capabilities; rather than keep one eye on what the next draft might offer instead. However, that could take away the parity across the league that the draft seeks to enforce, so there is no clear solution, but the current system is certainly flawed.</p>

<p>Although they are all a part of the gambling industry sports betting and online casinos have quite a notable number of differences.</p>



<p>However, online sports betting and online casinos have become the most popular ways that people are using to make real money online.</p>



<p>Due to this, there is always debate on which is the best one to work with when it comes to cashing in the big bucks.</p>



<p>With this in mind, here are some of the differences you should expect to find when betting with these online platforms.</p>



<p><strong>The Winning Odds</strong></p>



<p>According to a blog at <a href="https://www.cinemacasino.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="cinemacasino (opens in a new tab)">cinemacasino</a> sports betting and online casinos have a major difference when it comes to wagering and calculating your winning odds.</p>



<p>For instance, you have to use a sportsbook who have a fixed amount of money according to their requirements.</p>



<p>On the other hand, online casino games have random cash prizes. You can win $10000 from Mega Moolah while the next person wins millions.</p>



<p>Also, online casino wagering has what we call a house edge. Usually, this is what most online gamblers use to calculate their winning odds.</p>



<p>Contrary, sports bettors mainly use the probability technique to calculate their winning odds.</p>



<p>Also, bettors are forced to pay more money their intended wager due to the betting operational fees. </p>



<p><strong>Gambling Time Limits</strong></p>



<p>Unlike online casino games, sports betting is not always available for you anytime you need to make some real money online.</p>



<p>For example, if you are into soccer betting, you can only place a bet when there is a match or during the soccer league.</p>



<p>Whereas. Casino games are there for you to enjoy whenever you need them.</p>



<p><strong>Fun Betting Choices</strong></p>



<p>Online <a href="https://en.crazyvegas.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="us casinos (opens in a new tab)">us casinos</a> have over a thousand slot games you can pick from. To make it even more fun, the games come with different cartoons, movies and contemporary comic book themes.</p>



<p>This is contrary to the monotonous nature of sports betting.</p>

<p>Best Rated Olympic SportsThe Olympic Games are around the corner. And with so many games that will be aired at the same time, you may fail to find which sports to keep you entertained. That is why below we have a few sports that we are sure that you will find interesting during the Olympic Games.</p>



<p><strong>Top Rated Olympic Sports</strong></p>



<p><em>Gymnastics</em></p>



<p>While we can do most of the sports in our backyards, this one is not one of them. There is something about gymnastics that makes you wonder just how agile a person can be. </p>



<p>We talk of the breath-taking stunts as well as the way they manage to seamlessly add music to them. Gymnastics is one of the most fascinating sports ever. </p>



<p><em>Track Events</em></p>



<p>What’s not love about track and field events? They have both teams as individual events making them ideal for anyone wanting to have an adrenaline rush.</p>



<p>If these do not get your blood rushing, then we suggest online casino games at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="bestcasinositesonline (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.bestcasinositesonline.com/" target="_blank">bestcasinositesonline</a>. They can literally be sitting at the edge of the east especially if you are playing for real money.</p>



<p><em>Swimming</em></p>



<p>Watching the way that some people swim during the Olympics will have you wondering if mermaids really exist. Fine we understand that on land you are fast. However, this is the water and humans aren’t designed to live in water. This is what makes swimming a fascinating sport during the Olympics. </p>



<p><em>Wrestling, Taekwondo and Judo</em></p>



<p>These are also another set of some fascinating sports. A lot of people love action movies and with this they get to see if all those stunts during the movies are actually doable.</p>



<p><em>Volleyball, Beach and Field</em></p>



<p>Volleyball is another of the top rated Olympic sports as we’ve seen at <a href="https://www.newzealandcasinos.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="online casinos nz (opens in a new tab)">online casinos nz</a> sites. One of the things that made this sport so favourable was that from the beginning of the Olympic Games it was a sport that both men and women could play. As such attracting a large fan base.  </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>More Americans play basketball than any other sport and the popularity of this pastime continues to grow across the country. The NBA is also watched by millions of fans around the world with countries such as Canada, Australia and China amongst the most dedicated. As a result, this 30-team league is also incredibly popular with sports bettors and with each team playing 82 times throughout the regular season, there are always plenty of opportunities to get involved. There are hundreds of markets available ahead of each and every game and we take a look at three important aspects to consider before placing a wager on the sport. </p>



<p><strong>Focus on Specific Teams and Divisions </strong></p>



<p>The average bettor is unlikely to have time to follow the fortunes of all 30 franchises and it is possible to tie yourself in knots whilst trying to keep up with every single match throughout the course of the season. With fixtures taking place most nights and teams taking to the court every couple of days, newcomers may find the sheer volume of matches extremely overwhelming.</p>



<p>It is strongly advised to choose just a handful of sides to follow, paying particular attention to team news, match reports and camp morale. If you can follow their progress on TV, this will also prove beneficial. Alternatively, you could opt to hone in on a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="particular division such as the Central Division (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nba.com/standings/2019/division" target="_blank">particular division such as the Central Division</a> or the Pacific Division. This should allow for more in-depth analysis and subsequently result in far more informed picks.</p>



<p><strong>Be Wary of Back-to-Back Games</strong></p>



<p>Squeezing so many games into a relatively short period of time can result in teams playing back-to-back games on consecutive nights. Although this can help build up momentum, it may also prove to be a hindrance. Lack of recovery time can affect a player&#8217;s ability to perform and if a team has been involved in an energy-sapping contest, they may struggle to reach the same heights 24 hours later. This is particularly prevalent over the festive period and even the highest-ranked teams can struggle with the demanding fixture list.</p>



<p>In 2019, high-flying Miami Heat, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="who are +800 in the NBA betting (opens in a new tab)" href="https://extra.bet365.com/news/en/US-Sports/NBA" target="_blank">who are +800 in the NBA betting</a> to finish top of the Eastern Conference, saw their good form halted by a surprise defeat to the Washington Wizards. This came immediately off the back of a draining 117-116 overtime victory against the 76ers and was also their third game in four nights. Fatigue had clearly taken its toll.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MIAvsWAS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MIAvsWAS</a>: Coach Spo calls timeout to talk this one over&#8230;<br><br>HEAT trailing the Wizards 87-69 with 4:22 remaining in the 3rd quarter.

<p><em><strong>Beware of Market Reactions</strong></em></p>



<p>Injuries are part and parcel of the game and it is highly likely that every NBA side will suffer a number of setbacks throughout the course of the campaign. The markets can react quite strongly in favor of the opposition whenever a star player picks up an injury, although it may be occasionally worth swimming against the tide. The Bucks&#8217; odds drifted following the news that superstar forward <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Giannis Antetokounmpo had picked up a back injury (opens in a new tab)" href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2868774-bucks-giannis-antetokounmpo-out-for-2nd-straight-game-due-to-back-injury" target="_blank">Giannis Antetokounmpo had picked up a back injury</a>, however, the Milwaukee outfit still won each of the two games without the Greek-born star. Most coaches will have contingency plans in place and value can often by unearthed by backing the top sides to overcome these small setbacks.</p>

<p>Successful wagering on the NBA requires substantial patience and dedication, but savvy sports bettors should still be able to find plenty of betting opportunities throughout the course of the season. Following these three tips will hopefully help keep you on the winning track and make it much simpler to follow this fantastic competition.</p>

<p><strong>Betting and Casino Commandments in the UK</strong></p>



<p>If you want to have a successful betting career &#8211; you need to play your cards right. There are many more things that could go wrong than right. To that end, you need to educate yourself on the best course of action for betting and casino. Regardless if you live in the UK or anywhere else in the world – there is some timeless advice to follow. Read on.</p>



<p><strong>Determine the nature of your passion</strong></p>



<p>Are you serious about betting? Or you just want to place some bets from time to time? Are you into games of luck such as casino or you prefer betting and poker that is more skilled based?Answering these questions can have a profound impact on your betting career. It’s always a smart thing to know where you’re coming from. For new players there are certain casinos that offer free money to try the casino out. This could be a good option if you are unsure about your preferences. Check out this list of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="£10 GBP free casino (opens in a new tab)" href="https://newcasinostar.co.uk/10-gbp-free-casino/" target="_blank">£10 GBP free casino</a> that will give you either free money bonus no deposit or free spins. Make sure to read the bonus terms and condition before you register to make sure the bonus is still available.</p>



<p><strong>Create your own budgetary constraints</strong></p>



<p>Of course, different people have different levels of wealth and money. And some people have all but unlimited means with which they can bet. But most people fall somewhere between the two extremes. In all cases – you will do well to have budgetary constraints, therefor we recommend <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="creating a budget (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.hsbc.co.uk/guides/managing-money/how-to-create-a-budget/" target="_blank">creating a budget</a>. This will prevent you from losing more money than you could allow yourself to lose.</p>



<p><strong>Know your weaknesses</strong></p>



<p>If you sense that it’s easy for you to tilt once you lose a bet and to start betting more and more – then you should note this. This will arm you properly if you are to resist this temptation of yours. And typically, you will see that you have these quirks of sorts. It’s best if you know about them so that you can deal with them properly.</p>



<p><strong>Know the playing field</strong></p>



<p>If you know how to place bets and where to place them – then you’re halfway there to making money. However, there are also many other things that you should have in mind when it comes to betting. Combining the odds and finding the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="best betting tips (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.bettingtips.ke/" target="_blank">best betting tips</a> to bet on – this skillset will take years for you to master. So, start early and play often. Just be careful not to lose too much money in the process.</p>



<p><strong>In conclusion</strong></p>



<p>If you follow the advice from above – then you will have a good chance of becoming successful. Of course, no one can guarantee it – given the volatile nature of betting. However, what we can guarantee is that you will dramatically increase your odds of winning more money than losing. And we hope that you will have that bit of luck that it takes for you to be successful.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Originally being an activity primarily held at the weekend, the growing popularity and wider range of football fixtures has made it possible to create your own <a href="https://footyaccumulators.com/football-tips">tips for football betting daily </a>each week. All potential outcomes are covered by the extensive markets from the bookmakers, and additional competitions such as the Champions League, Europa League, EFL Cup and FA Cup allow for even more fixtures to place money on.</p>



<p>The masses of options for how you choose to make football betting tips are seen as a positive and a negative, making it easier to bet on exactly what you think is likely to happen, but also being seen as an obstacle for inexperienced punters who struggle to identify what to bet on.It’s likely that another football fixture is on the cards throughout the current week &#8211; as well as plenty of the expected weekend games &#8211; but if you’re looking to bet on one of the many weekday games, we’ve offered a helping hand on how to pick insightful football betting tips between Monday and Friday.</p>



<p><strong>Choose your football fixture(s)</strong></p>



<p>Bookmaker apps and websites provide odds on all scheduled matches several weeks in advance, making it possible to back your bets early and take the best price. Monday night football continues the selection of games at the weekend and you’ll often find a Friday night fixture to kick off the next weekend in a similar style, with games also often played between Tuesday and Thursday, especially for domestic and European competitions. Through choosing your match, which is likely to be from one of Europe’s more recognised leagues, you can create football betting tips as a single, introduce other games to make a football accumulator, or back an enhanced market that’s been boosted by your chosen bookmaker.</p>



<p><strong>Select your method of betting</strong></p>



<p>You might not realise it, but football betting tips come in all different shapes and sizes. With this being the case, you aren’t solely limited to predicting the match result, instead being given the opportunity to bet on every possible outcome over ninety minutes including over 2.5 goals, both teams to score, anytime goalscorers, and many other more extensive options. The bookies continue to cater to a more varied array of different markets to enhance your football betting tips, which helps massively as it prevents you from backing something else due to the fact that you can’t be specific with your football prediction.</p>



<p><strong>Back your bet at the biggest odds</strong></p>



<p>The last port of call for backing any bets is to assure
that you’re placing them at the biggest available odds. It’s easy to do this by
cross-referencing the price you’ve been given over all popular bookmakers, with
it being a worthwhile process as each bookie possesses a different price. You
shouldn’t base your football betting tips on the odds you’re being given, but
they can be an indication of their chances of landing, with higher odds often
meaning that the bookies are doubting that your bet will win.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Travelling across Europe to watch your favourite team play in the Champions League is never a cheap venture, but the amount can vary massively depending on the group stage draw.</p>
<p>This season Manchester City, Liverpool, Tottenham and Manchester United are all competing in Europe’s premier tournament, in the hope that they can propel English club football back to the top.</p>
<p>Manchester City are the current favourites to win the tournament and according to <a href="https://www.betfair.com/exchange/plus/football/competition/228" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Champions League betting</a>, they are 9/2, just ahead of Barcelona who are 5/1.</p>
<p><strong>Manchester City</strong></p>
<p>Despite being the favourites, City lost their opening game, as Lyon stunned the Premier League champions, winning 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium.</p>
<p>City have also travelled to their other two group stage opponents, Hoffenheim and Shakhtar Donetsk and picked up maximum points, renewing their hope of winning a first Champions League title.</p>
<p><strong>Liverpool</strong></p>
<p>The Reds finished as the runners-up in last season’s Champions League, losing out to Real Madrid in the final. This season, they have been drawn against Serie A runners-up Napoli, Ligue 1 winners PSG and Serbian SuperLiga winners Red Star Belgrade.</p>
<p>Liverpool have played one away match so far, a trip to Naples to take on Napoli, a match in which they lost in the dying minutes thanks to a goal from Lorenzo Insigne. Their fans still have trips to Paris and Belgrade to look forward to.</p>
<p><strong>Tottenham Hotspur</strong></p>
<p>When Spurs fans watched the draw for the Champions League group stage this season, alarm bells began to ring as they were drawn against Barcelona, Inter Milan and PSV Eindhoven.</p>
<p>Having failed to win so far, losing away to Inter Milan and at home to Barcelona and then drawing away to PSV, Tottenham’s hopes of reaching the knockout phase have been severely dented. Although Spurs fans have arguably the easiest away trips with regards to journey times, that will be of little comfort given their current form in Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Manchester United</strong></p>
<p>Jose Mourinho has endured a poor start to his third season in charge of Manchester United. The Red Devils currently lie in 8th place in the Premier League and haven’t fared much better in Europe, winning only one of their opening three Champions League matches, away to BSC Young Boys.</p>
<p>United still have to travel to Valencia and Turin before knowing their final position within the group. These away trips will see the Red Devils face a struggling Valencia and a Juventus team who have former United star Cristiano Ronaldo at their disposal.</p>
<p>The infographic below examines the price the English fans must pay to watch their team away in the Champions League.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There have already been a number of star performers even at this early stage of the premier league season. Chelsea are the surprise package at present as punters continue to use the latest <a href="https://www.us-bookies.com/fanduel-sportsbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offer at fanduel</a> to support them for the title. Can they topple the defending champions Manchester City and the attacking powerhouses of Liverpool? Here we cover some of the stars of the season thus far.</p>
<p><strong>ALISSON &#8211; LIVERPOOL</strong></p>
<p>Liverpool’s keeper, Alisson has been a key addition to the squad. He has made a solid start to the season as the club continue to challenge for the league. At present eight games in, he is one of two keepers to have only conceded three goals. He also sits at the top of the table for saved shot percentage, so can be help them end their wait for another league title.</p>
<p><strong>JOHN STONES – MANCHESTER CITY</strong></p>
<p>It is exciting times for English football as the national team continues to go from strength to strength. They are coming off the back of a starring performance in beating Spain, and one player who is continuing to improve is <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.com/john-stones/profil/spieler/186590" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defender, John Stones</a>. The Manchester City defender is proving a revelation at the back since a stuttering start as pressure piled on him due to his big money move. He sits at the top of the interception, clearance and pass completion charts. He is set to play a leading role in their attempt to defend the premier league title.</p>
<p><strong>JORGINHO &#8211; CHELSEA</strong></p>
<p>He does not do anything flash but the impact he has on the team is unquestionable. He followed Chelsea’s new manager Sarri over from Napoli just showing the esteem he is held in. Chelsea are now renowned for the vast amount of passes they make and this is headed by the Italian. Jorginho continues to control the side from the middle and is all but set to break the premier league passing record unless an injury occurs.</p>
<p><strong>EDEN HAZARD– CHELSEA</strong></p>
<p>Another Chelsea player and the current star of the season is Eden Hazard. He kicked off the current campaign in flying form following a starring role for Belgium at the world cup in Russia. He sits at the top of the scoring charts and he really looks to be excelling from the role he is playing under new manager, Sarri. Hazard is now in talks as a future winner of the Ballon d’or but can he first help lead Chelsea to another premier league title.</p>
