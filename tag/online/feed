										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Every year the NBA draft is followed by millions of eager basketball fans around the world, as the most promising international and college prospects are chosen. The first picks typically go to the worst teams from the previous season, within a system that is aimed at making the NBA competitive. Nevertheless, it’s also a system with some glaring flaws, which includes encouraging teams to underperform and tank, in order to get better picks.</p>



<p>Perhaps the best example of a team tanking during the 2019-20 season is the Golden State Warriors. This is the same franchise which has dominated the NBA in recent years, reaching five consecutive NBA Finals since 2015 and winning the championship three times. Now they are completely unrecognizable, rock-bottom of the Western Conference and the first team to be mathematically eliminated from playoff contention.</p>



<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aZ5n0pPX5wU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>The Milwaukee Bucks convincingly top the Eastern Conference and the Los Angeles Lakers dominate in the Western Conference, with both tipped as favorites to reach the Finals prior to the enforced break, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://extra.bet365.com/news/en/US-Sports/NBA" target="_blank">according to the NBA betting on bet365</a>, yet casual observers are unable to understand why the Golden State Warriors aren’t up there competing with them. The answer is quite simple – the Warriors are tanking to ensure they get better draft options.</p>



<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WlvU4XlGQy4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>In the world of competitive professional sports, it might be hard to comprehend a situation whereby losing can be regarded as ultimately more rewarding than winning. However, this is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://allthingsnba.news.blog/2019/03/23/the-nba-draft-lottery-paradox/" target="_blank">the paradox created by the NBA draft system</a>. The aim of the draft is noble, for sure, because it gives the worst teams each season a chance to improve.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, it also creates a situation whereby franchises can exploit that noble aim. Since the introduction of the NBA draft Lottery, the odds are stacked heavily in favor of the worst teams for the first four picks. This means they will get the best new players entering the NBA. Ahead of the next NBA draft, the Golden State Warriors are the worst team in either conference, which means they have the joint-best odds of landing the highest-ranked players.</p>



<p>As this <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1160424-golden-state-warriors-why-the-warriors-tanking-is-hurting-the-nba" target="_blank">2012 article published by Bleacher Report highlights</a>, it’s not the first time the Warriors have looked ahead to the draft, rather than focus on winning. Back then, the way they concluded the season was called into question, apparently valuing better draft options above the prestige of competing to finish higher in the league rankings. 2019-20 results have been so bad, it seems like the Warriors are taking the same approach to a new extreme.</p>



<p>In some regards, this has created a race to the bottom where GM’s value first picks in the draft, along with the chance to sign a potential All-Star player, ahead of team performance during a season that isn’t going so well. For this reason alone, it’s clear that the draft system needs to be constantly reviewed and revised.</p>



<p>Some have suggested a completely open lottery, with no preferential order amongst teams in the draft system based around conference positions from the previous season. Perhaps this approach would discourage teams from tanking, and restore the purity of competition to the NBA, with teams aiming to perform within the best of their capabilities; rather than keep one eye on what the next draft might offer instead. However, that could take away the parity across the league that the draft seeks to enforce, so there is no clear solution, but the current system is certainly flawed.</p>

<p>Best Rated Olympic SportsThe Olympic Games are around the corner. And with so many games that will be aired at the same time, you may fail to find which sports to keep you entertained. That is why below we have a few sports that we are sure that you will find interesting during the Olympic Games.</p>



<p><strong>Top Rated Olympic Sports</strong></p>



<p><em>Gymnastics</em></p>



<p>While we can do most of the sports in our backyards, this one is not one of them. There is something about gymnastics that makes you wonder just how agile a person can be. </p>



<p>We talk of the breath-taking stunts as well as the way they manage to seamlessly add music to them. Gymnastics is one of the most fascinating sports ever. </p>



<p><em>Track Events</em></p>



<p>What’s not love about track and field events? They have both teams as individual events making them ideal for anyone wanting to have an adrenaline rush.</p>



<p>If these do not get your blood rushing, then we suggest online casino games at <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="bestcasinositesonline (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.bestcasinositesonline.com/" target="_blank">bestcasinositesonline</a>. They can literally be sitting at the edge of the east especially if you are playing for real money.</p>



<p><em>Swimming</em></p>



<p>Watching the way that some people swim during the Olympics will have you wondering if mermaids really exist. Fine we understand that on land you are fast. However, this is the water and humans aren’t designed to live in water. This is what makes swimming a fascinating sport during the Olympics. </p>



<p><em>Wrestling, Taekwondo and Judo</em></p>



<p>These are also another set of some fascinating sports. A lot of people love action movies and with this they get to see if all those stunts during the movies are actually doable.</p>



<p><em>Volleyball, Beach and Field</em></p>



<p>Volleyball is another of the top rated Olympic sports as we’ve seen at <a href="https://www.newzealandcasinos.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="online casinos nz (opens in a new tab)">online casinos nz</a> sites. One of the things that made this sport so favourable was that from the beginning of the Olympic Games it was a sport that both men and women could play. As such attracting a large fan base.  </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>More Americans play basketball than any other sport and the popularity of this pastime continues to grow across the country. The NBA is also watched by millions of fans around the world with countries such as Canada, Australia and China amongst the most dedicated. As a result, this 30-team league is also incredibly popular with sports bettors and with each team playing 82 times throughout the regular season, there are always plenty of opportunities to get involved. There are hundreds of markets available ahead of each and every game and we take a look at three important aspects to consider before placing a wager on the sport. </p>



<p><strong>Focus on Specific Teams and Divisions </strong></p>



<p>The average bettor is unlikely to have time to follow the fortunes of all 30 franchises and it is possible to tie yourself in knots whilst trying to keep up with every single match throughout the course of the season. With fixtures taking place most nights and teams taking to the court every couple of days, newcomers may find the sheer volume of matches extremely overwhelming.</p>



<p>It is strongly advised to choose just a handful of sides to follow, paying particular attention to team news, match reports and camp morale. If you can follow their progress on TV, this will also prove beneficial. Alternatively, you could opt to hone in on a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="particular division such as the Central Division (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nba.com/standings/2019/division" target="_blank">particular division such as the Central Division</a> or the Pacific Division. This should allow for more in-depth analysis and subsequently result in far more informed picks.</p>



<p><strong>Be Wary of Back-to-Back Games</strong></p>



<p>Squeezing so many games into a relatively short period of time can result in teams playing back-to-back games on consecutive nights. Although this can help build up momentum, it may also prove to be a hindrance. Lack of recovery time can affect a player&#8217;s ability to perform and if a team has been involved in an energy-sapping contest, they may struggle to reach the same heights 24 hours later. This is particularly prevalent over the festive period and even the highest-ranked teams can struggle with the demanding fixture list.</p>



<p>In 2019, high-flying Miami Heat, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="who are +800 in the NBA betting (opens in a new tab)" href="https://extra.bet365.com/news/en/US-Sports/NBA" target="_blank">who are +800 in the NBA betting</a> to finish top of the Eastern Conference, saw their good form halted by a surprise defeat to the Washington Wizards. This came immediately off the back of a draining 117-116 overtime victory against the 76ers and was also their third game in four nights. Fatigue had clearly taken its toll.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MIAvsWAS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MIAvsWAS</a>: Coach Spo calls timeout to talk this one over&#8230;<br><br>HEAT trailing the Wizards 87-69 with 4:22 remaining in the 3rd quarter. Down, but not out. <a href="https://t.co/xWfkL1u3QB">pic.twitter.com/xWfkL1u3QB</a></p>&mdash; Miami HEAT (@MiamiHEAT) <a href="https://twitter.com/MiamiHEAT/status/1211825472901914624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>




<p><em><strong>Beware of Market Reactions</strong></em></p>



<p>Injuries are part and parcel of the game and it is highly likely that every NBA side will suffer a number of setbacks throughout the course of the campaign. The markets can react quite strongly in favor of the opposition whenever a star player picks up an injury, although it may be occasionally worth swimming against the tide. The Bucks&#8217; odds drifted following the news that superstar forward <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Giannis Antetokounmpo had picked up a back injury (opens in a new tab)" href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2868774-bucks-giannis-antetokounmpo-out-for-2nd-straight-game-due-to-back-injury" target="_blank">Giannis Antetokounmpo had picked up a back injury</a>, however, the Milwaukee outfit still won each of the two games without the Greek-born star. Most coaches will have contingency plans in place and value can often by unearthed by backing the top sides to overcome these small setbacks.</p>

<p>Successful wagering on the NBA requires substantial patience and dedication, but savvy sports bettors should still be able to find plenty of betting opportunities throughout the course of the season. Following these three tips will hopefully help keep you on the winning track and make it much simpler to follow this fantastic competition.</p>

<p>After an incredibly <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="bright start to their Euro 2020 qualification bid (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47578575" target="_blank">bright start to their Euro 2020 qualification bid</a>, England are in the driving seat as far as progressing to the finals is concerned and, although it is a tournament that will be hosted across the continent, it does have the air of a home championships at the same time.</p>



<figure><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KpNcoYNfbOs" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure>



<p>That’s because one of the final four meetings and the showpiece event itself, are to be held at England’s Wembley Stadium and this means the Three Lions could be playing some highly important fixtures in very familiar surroundings.</p>



<p>The last time England hosted the European Championships was back in 1996 and it really was the summer in which football did come home. Although Terry Venables’ men were denied an appearance in the final by Germany, it is a tournament that lives long in the memory.</p>



<p>While although the summer of ’96 is now etched in football folklore as far as England fans are concerned, it is perhaps time to stop looking to the past and instead look to what is on offer in this present day and age.</p>



<p></p>



<p>That’s because England have been the nearly-men of international football in the last two years and, after semi-final appearances at both the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA Nations League, the belief is that now is their time.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a belief that is shared by pundits and punters alike; <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="a look at the current international football betting (opens in a new tab)" href="https://extra.bet365.com/news/en/football/international-football" target="_blank">a look at the current international football betting</a> has this young squad well placed to end their international trophy drought – a drought that is now 53 years and counting.</p>



<p>With England currently priced at 9/2 second-favorites with bet365, there is not much standing between them and being kings of Europe next summer. However, that’s not to say they will go unchallenged either.</p>



<p>When discussing the runners and riders for Euro 2020, one cannot leave France out of the conversation and, as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="current World Champions (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/15/france-croatia-world-cup-final-match-report" target="_blank">current World Champions</a>, they will be looking to emulate the achievements of the previous generation some twenty years prior.</p>



<figure><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GrsEAvRerTg" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure>



<p>Back in 2000, David Trezeguet scored a Golden-Goal extra-time winner against Italy, which meant that this legendary French team added the European Championship to their first-ever World Cup win two years before.</p>



<p>Not only that, but France will be looking to go one better after losing in the final of Euro 2016 and, with the rich pedigree that this talented group of players have, it comes as no surprise that bet365 have made them 7/2 favourites to win a third European Championship next year.</p>



<p>Much will depend on the likes of Barcelona’s Antoine Griezmann and Manchester United’s Paul Pogba, who, in the case of the latter, has a recent tendency to play better for his country rather than this club.</p>



<p>Much will depend on the likes of Barcelona’s Antoine Griezmann and Manchester United’s Paul Pogba, who, in the case of the latter, has a recent tendency to play better for his country rather than this club.</p>



<p>However, if they fail to lead France to success, then a certain Harry Kane will be lying in wait and what better sight would there be for English football than the Tottenham forward lifting the Henri Deulauney trophy in front of his countrymen. Time will tell if this fantasy becomes a reality.</p>

<p><strong>Sports Betting Tips and Predictions</strong></p>



<p>It’s important to learn a few important things about online betting. This goes regardless of which country you’re coming from – if you’re from UK or someplace else. That being said, there is timeless advice to be learned by online betting. And the earlier you know it – the better off you will be. So, read more about some of the most important elements of successful online betting.</p>



<p><strong>Screening the playground</strong></p>



<p>If you want to be successful in online betting – then you need knowledge of the playground. It gets difficult to do this once you realize the vastness of the playground. There are dozens of different sports to consider and hundreds or more of individual games. And then you need to consider the individual differences between all of these categories. It’s not an easy task and few can brag that they have done it. But you don’t need to make things difficult for yourself – more than they already are. What you can do is zone in on one particular aspect of in the sports itself and to bet on that. It could be one type of betting, one sport, one country or one league or even one team. Learn all you can about it. And then apply your knowledge. Recently we heard of one player that only using <a href="https://www.bettingtipsnigeria.com/betting-sites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">betting sites in Nigeria</a> to place his bets. To specialise in Nigerian or another African country could be a competitive advantage.</p>



<p><strong>Pick the best betting sites</strong></p>



<p>We’re speaking primarily about online betting now. But this goes for regular betting, too. The site that you will select has the power to dramatically change your experience. Nobody would like using a broken down website. For that matter – nobody would like to use the services of a shady betting site. To that end, only seek out the highest-quality betting platforms (like for example the ones using <a href="https://kambi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kambi</a>). They will guarantee that you will have the best experience and the best possible odds.</p>



<p><strong>Be prepared to lose in order to win in the long run</strong></p>



<p>Not a single person was born an expert in the field of online betting. It takes practice and years of dedication before you develop expertise. And of course – this can be costly. The process isn’t easy and it’s rather long. But if you pay attention to the right things – then you will be able to reap your rewards down the line. One recommendation is to use new betting and casino sites. They often offer more generous bonus offer than established ones. Find the <a href="https://casinoviking.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">latest new casino sites at CasinoViking</a> that offer fantastic welcome bonuses to UK players. There are also other many other website that you can use to compare and find new betting and casino sites.</p>

<p><strong>Betting and Casino Commandments in the UK</strong></p>



<p>If you want to have a successful betting career &#8211; you need to play your cards right. There are many more things that could go wrong than right. To that end, you need to educate yourself on the best course of action for betting and casino. Regardless if you live in the UK or anywhere else in the world – there is some timeless advice to follow. Read on.</p>



<p><strong>Determine the nature of your passion</strong></p>



<p>Are you serious about betting? Or you just want to place some bets from time to time? Are you into games of luck such as casino or you prefer betting and poker that is more skilled based?Answering these questions can have a profound impact on your betting career. It’s always a smart thing to know where you’re coming from. For new players there are certain casinos that offer free money to try the casino out. This could be a good option if you are unsure about your preferences. Check out this list of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="£10 GBP free casino (opens in a new tab)" href="https://newcasinostar.co.uk/10-gbp-free-casino/" target="_blank">£10 GBP free casino</a> that will give you either free money bonus no deposit or free spins. Make sure to read the bonus terms and condition before you register to make sure the bonus is still available.</p>



<p><strong>Create your own budgetary constraints</strong></p>



<p>Of course, different people have different levels of wealth and money. And some people have all but unlimited means with which they can bet. But most people fall somewhere between the two extremes. In all cases – you will do well to have budgetary constraints, therefor we recommend <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="creating a budget (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.hsbc.co.uk/guides/managing-money/how-to-create-a-budget/" target="_blank">creating a budget</a>. This will prevent you from losing more money than you could allow yourself to lose.</p>



<p><strong>Know your weaknesses</strong></p>



<p>If you sense that it’s easy for you to tilt once you lose a bet and to start betting more and more – then you should note this. This will arm you properly if you are to resist this temptation of yours. And typically, you will see that you have these quirks of sorts. It’s best if you know about them so that you can deal with them properly.</p>



<p><strong>Know the playing field</strong></p>



<p>If you know how to place bets and where to place them – then you’re halfway there to making money. However, there are also many other things that you should have in mind when it comes to betting. Combining the odds and finding the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="best betting tips (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.bettingtips.ke/" target="_blank">best betting tips</a> to bet on – this skillset will take years for you to master. So, start early and play often. Just be careful not to lose too much money in the process.</p>



<p><strong>In conclusion</strong></p>



<p>If you follow the advice from above – then you will have a good chance of becoming successful. Of course, no one can guarantee it – given the volatile nature of betting. However, what we can guarantee is that you will dramatically increase your odds of winning more money than losing. And we hope that you will have that bit of luck that it takes for you to be successful.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Originally being an activity primarily held at the weekend, the growing popularity and wider range of football fixtures has made it possible to create your own <a href="https://footyaccumulators.com/football-tips">tips for football betting daily </a>each week. All potential outcomes are covered by the extensive markets from the bookmakers, and additional competitions such as the Champions League, Europa League, EFL Cup and FA Cup allow for even more fixtures to place money on.</p>



<p>The masses of options for how you choose to make football betting tips are seen as a positive and a negative, making it easier to bet on exactly what you think is likely to happen, but also being seen as an obstacle for inexperienced punters who struggle to identify what to bet on.It’s likely that another football fixture is on the cards throughout the current week &#8211; as well as plenty of the expected weekend games &#8211; but if you’re looking to bet on one of the many weekday games, we’ve offered a helping hand on how to pick insightful football betting tips between Monday and Friday.</p>



<p><strong>Choose your football fixture(s)</strong></p>



<p>Bookmaker apps and websites provide odds on all scheduled matches several weeks in advance, making it possible to back your bets early and take the best price. Monday night football continues the selection of games at the weekend and you’ll often find a Friday night fixture to kick off the next weekend in a similar style, with games also often played between Tuesday and Thursday, especially for domestic and European competitions. Through choosing your match, which is likely to be from one of Europe’s more recognised leagues, you can create football betting tips as a single, introduce other games to make a football accumulator, or back an enhanced market that’s been boosted by your chosen bookmaker.</p>



<p><strong>Select your method of betting</strong></p>



<p>You might not realise it, but football betting tips come in all different shapes and sizes. With this being the case, you aren’t solely limited to predicting the match result, instead being given the opportunity to bet on every possible outcome over ninety minutes including over 2.5 goals, both teams to score, anytime goalscorers, and many other more extensive options. The bookies continue to cater to a more varied array of different markets to enhance your football betting tips, which helps massively as it prevents you from backing something else due to the fact that you can’t be specific with your football prediction.</p>



<p><strong>Back your bet at the biggest odds</strong></p>



<p>The last port of call for backing any bets is to assure
that you’re placing them at the biggest available odds. It’s easy to do this by
cross-referencing the price you’ve been given over all popular bookmakers, with
it being a worthwhile process as each bookie possesses a different price. You
shouldn’t base your football betting tips on the odds you’re being given, but
they can be an indication of their chances of landing, with higher odds often
meaning that the bookies are doubting that your bet will win.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Travelling across Europe to watch your favourite team play in the Champions League is never a cheap venture, but the amount can vary massively depending on the group stage draw.</p>
<p>This season Manchester City, Liverpool, Tottenham and Manchester United are all competing in Europe’s premier tournament, in the hope that they can propel English club football back to the top.</p>
<p>Manchester City are the current favourites to win the tournament and according to <a href="https://www.betfair.com/exchange/plus/football/competition/228" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Champions League betting</a>, they are 9/2, just ahead of Barcelona who are 5/1.</p>
<p><strong>Manchester City</strong></p>
<p>Despite being the favourites, City lost their opening game, as Lyon stunned the Premier League champions, winning 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium.</p>
<p>City have also travelled to their other two group stage opponents, Hoffenheim and Shakhtar Donetsk and picked up maximum points, renewing their hope of winning a first Champions League title.</p>
<p><strong>Liverpool</strong></p>
<p>The Reds finished as the runners-up in last season’s Champions League, losing out to Real Madrid in the final. This season, they have been drawn against Serie A runners-up Napoli, Ligue 1 winners PSG and Serbian SuperLiga winners Red Star Belgrade.</p>
<p>Liverpool have played one away match so far, a trip to Naples to take on Napoli, a match in which they lost in the dying minutes thanks to a goal from Lorenzo Insigne. Their fans still have trips to Paris and Belgrade to look forward to.</p>
<p><strong>Tottenham Hotspur</strong></p>
<p>When Spurs fans watched the draw for the Champions League group stage this season, alarm bells began to ring as they were drawn against Barcelona, Inter Milan and PSV Eindhoven.</p>
<p>Having failed to win so far, losing away to Inter Milan and at home to Barcelona and then drawing away to PSV, Tottenham’s hopes of reaching the knockout phase have been severely dented. Although Spurs fans have arguably the easiest away trips with regards to journey times, that will be of little comfort given their current form in Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Manchester United</strong></p>
<p>Jose Mourinho has endured a poor start to his third season in charge of Manchester United. The Red Devils currently lie in 8th place in the Premier League and haven’t fared much better in Europe, winning only one of their opening three Champions League matches, away to BSC Young Boys.</p>
<p>United still have to travel to Valencia and Turin before knowing their final position within the group. These away trips will see the Red Devils face a struggling Valencia and a Juventus team who have former United star Cristiano Ronaldo at their disposal.</p>
<p>The infographic below examines the price the English fans must pay to watch their team away in the Champions League.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>All eyes will be on the big fight this weekend as KhabibNurmagomedov and Conor McGregor will be facing off against each other for the Lightweight Championship. The <a href="https://www.paddypower.com/mixed-martial-arts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Khabib McGregor odds</a> suggest that the unbeaten Russian lightweight is the favourite, but it could go either way.</p>
<p>These two fighters might be some of the biggest names in the sport at the moment, but they aren’t the longest serving competitors in the competition. We have taken a look 5 fighters with the longest UFC careers.</p>
<p><strong>Jim Miller – 30 bouts</strong><br />
American fighter Jim Miller currently holds the record for the most UFC bouts, entering the cage 30 times during his career. The UFC lightweight started his professional mixed martial art career in 2005 in the ‘Reality Fighting’ competition, but didn’t join the UFC until July 2008.</p>
<p>His debut came just a few months later at UFC 89. Although Miller was only one of the preliminary matches, his UFC career got off to the best start by defeating David Baron via submission, being awarded the ‘Submission of the Night’ award.</p>
<p>Since making his UFC debut ten years ago, Miller has gone on to make 30 appearances in the cage, winning 18 of them.</p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Stephens – 29 bouts</strong><br />
Like Miller, Jeremy Stephens started his professional mixed martial arts career in 2005, fighting in numerous competitions before joining the UFC in 2007. However, unlike Miller, Stephens’ first fight didn’t go to plan as he was defeated via a second round armbar submission against UFC veteran Din Thomas.</p>
<p>Although the lightweight and featherweight fighter didn’t get off to the best start in the promotion, Stephens has enjoyed a fairly successfully career. In total, Jeremy Stephens has entered the cage 29 times in the past, winning 15 of them.</p>
<p>His defeat to José Aldo put an end to his three-fight winning streak, but leaves him just one fight away from matching Jim Miller’s bout total.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Bisping – 29 bouts</strong><br />
Although Michael Bisping might have announced his retirement from MMA competitions earlier this year, he will be regarded as one of the longest serving competitors in the competition with 29 bouts under his belt. Whilst the majority of UFC fighters usually started their professional career at 18, Bisping started in 2004 at the relatively late age of 25.</p>
<p>Despite the ‘late’ start to his career, Bisping got off to a great start by winning his first 10 fights before being signed by the UFC.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t maintain his unbeaten record throughout his career, his record during his time in the UFC was very respectable, finishing with 20 wins and 9 defeats in 29 matches.</p>
<p><strong>Diego Sanchez – 28 bouts</strong><br />
Since joining the competition in 2005, Sanchez has spent the majority of his career in the UFC and is currently the longest tenured UFC fighter on the active roster. The American has competed in many different fighting divisions over the years, and is currently competing as a ‘lightweight’ and ‘welterweight’.</p>
<p>After spending the first few years of his career in the ‘King of the Cage’ tournaments, Sanchez finally got his ‘break’ with the UFC as he was a participant and winner on the first season of the reality show ‘The Ultimate Fighter’. His victory led to the fighter signing a contract with the UFC and immediately being put in a ‘main card’ fight in his first UFC competition.</p>
<p>From 2005 to 2009, Sanchez was one of the most feared and ‘unstoppable’ fighters in the competition, winning 10 of his first 13 bouts. Although Sanchez has failed to put together a good winning</p>
<p>streak in the past few years, his is still considered one of the best competitors in the UFC.</p>
<p>In total, Sanchez has been involved with the UFC for 4,926 days (as of 03/10/2018) – the longest out of any active UFC fighter.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Mir – 27 bouts</strong><br />
Although Diego Sanchez is currently the longest tenured active fighter, Frank Mir held that title before his <a href="https://mmajunkie.com/2017/07/frank-mir-ufc-heavyweight-champion-release" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release from the UFC in 2016</a> with 5,557 continuous days with the UFC from 2nd November 2001 until 20th March 2016.</p>
<p>From a young age, Mir showed huge potential in wrestling and martial arts and was soon signed up to the UFC in 2001 following two wins in other MMA competitions. Throughout the majority of his time in the UFC, Mir won most of his fights by knockout or submission, only relying on the judges’ decision twice. In the later years of his time with the UFC, Mir experienced more defeats than wins. Despite this, Mir has gone down as a legend in the competition.</p>
<p>The “biggest fight in UFC history” is set to take place this Saturday at the T-Mobile Arena in Vegas. Although it’s the first time that the two will be fighting against each other, the two fighters have a history with one another which has turned from respect into a full blown rivalry.</p>
<p>Considering that Khabib hasn’t experienced a single defeat in his professional career and McGregor hasn’t entered the cage in two years, it seems that a Khabib win is the most likely outcome. However, McGregor is a very difficult fighter and will want to put an end to his rivals’ unbeaten record.</p>
