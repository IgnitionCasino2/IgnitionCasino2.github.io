										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Did Mexico&#8217;s Win Over Germany Cause an Earthquake?</strong></p>
<p>Late in the morning of Sunday the 17th of June, Mexico City’s seismic sensors picked up what was reportedly a minor earthquake. But it was not triggered naturally, says the group in charge of monitoring the gauges.</p>
<p>The Institute of Geologic and Atmospheric Investigations in Mexico, the group in question, said that it has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/17/world/americas/mexico-soccer-world-cup.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quite possibly been caused because of mass jumping</a>. Apparently at least two sensors picked up the activity. The cause for the jumping?</p>
<p><strong>The Mexicans Routed Germany</strong></p>
<p>As football punters enjoying the World Cup thanks to <a href="https://australiansportsbetting.net.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Australian sports betting</a> will be able to tell you, moments previously Mexico had managed to score a goal against Germany. The Mexican men’s national football team scored against the European powerhouse in their Group Stage match in the World Cup in Moscow.</p>
<p>The Mexicans went on to to win the match outright, at 1 — 0, defeating the World Cup Champions and taking a place of pride in one of the biggest upsets in the history of Mexico’s World Cup participation.</p>
<p><strong>Clear Indications of How Much the Win Means</strong></p>
<p>One need only glance at Mexico City’s seismographs to get an idea of how important this victory was to the country. But there was a lot of other evidence as well.</p>
<p>After the final whistle blew, households all over the country erupted in celebration, with people pouring in to the streets to share their joy. Strangers embraced one another as family, and the jubilation went on for ages.</p>
<p><strong>Finally Some Good News for Mexico</strong></p>
<p>Car horns created a cacophony for a long time, and elated fans transformed public plazas into huge parties, with Mexican flags being waved, songs being sung, and chanting accompanying the celebratory drinks and sprays of foam.</p>
<p>This jubilation was obviously not simply about the win. For many, the victory was not just the first major World Cup surprise, but finally something for Mexico to celebrate in the face of grim news for the county alongside a <a href="https://quizmymates.com/history/political-scandals-rocked-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political campaign</a> season that is becoming progressively more toxic.</p>
<p>The elections are set to be held for July 1, and will decide on over 3 000 posts at local, state, and federal levels, including the presidency. And that’s not even mentioning the gradually more outrageous, increasingly more disgusting propaganda being spewed by a certain Cheeto-coloured previous reality star who shall remain nameless here.</p>
<p>Juan Rodrigo Guadarrama, a 32-year old taxi driver in Mexico City spoke for many when he talked about what a wonderful surprise the win had been. He said he had initially not even wanted to watch the game, since he thought that there was no chance that the Mexicans would prevail, and he truly believed he would be watching the one and only game his national team would play. He said that the win has renewed hope for many, and spoke of it bringing people who are polarised and at each other’s throats back together. He added that it made one believe that truly miraculous things were possible!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cesc Fabregas. Dani Parejo. Juan Mata. Ander Herrera. Pedro Rodriguez. Javi Martinez. Marcos Alonso. Hector Bellerin. Sergi Roberto. All names that any manager would love to have in their lineup, but names not even good enough to make Spain’s 23. Despite all their midfield and defense riches, Spain’s attack tells a different story. The 2010 winners are currently the 3rd favourites in <a href="https://www.betfair.com/exchange/plus/football/competition/5614746" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World cup 2018 odds</a> to win it for only the second time in their history.</p>
<p>Even in the Fernando Torres-David Villa peak days of yore, attack was perhaps never Spain’s strongest suit. It showed &#8211; even in their victorious 2010 World Cup campaign, Spain only scored more than 1 goal in just 2 games &#8211; and won all their knockout matches by the same score, 1-0. But it was different back then &#8211; their USP &#8211; a midfield full of all-time legends in Sergio Busquets, Andres Iniesta and Xavi Hernandez, knew that they could take their time on the ball, patiently break teams down through their patented style of play, tiki-taka, and when the chance came, a world-class striker would be there to bury it.<br />
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aKSHgMqCwbQ?start=170" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><br />
But as Torres and Villa declined, Spain moved on. Necessity is the mother of innovation, as the saying goes. Vincent del Bosque trialled a striker-less 4-6-0 formation at Euro 2012, with a front 3 of David Silva, Fabregas and Iniesta &#8211; all 3 central midfielders by trade. Fabregas would be the central of the 3, and the La Roja’s furthest forward player. The term “false 9” was popularized. Despite the flak del Bosque copped, it worked. Spain did not create many chances in the final third, played “boring” football, focused on keeping the ball than creating chances &#8211; yet they emerged comfortable winners, blitzing Italy 4-0 in the final.</p>
<p>Another major tournament saw another major change &#8211; as the 2014 World Cup rolled by, Spain again saw a change of guard in attack. Brazilian-born Diego Costa, previously snubbed by his nation of birth, obtained Spanish citizenship in the build-up to the tournament. Costa had had a sensational season in 2013-14 &#8211; his 27 league goals in 35 appearances not only gave Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo a run for their money in the Pichichi rankings, but also led Atletico Madrid to a sensational league title victory &#8211; ending the Barcelona-Real Madrid duopoly, and as far as a heartbreaking extra time defeat in the Champions League final to cross-town rivals Real.</p>
<p>But it didn’t work out &#8211; champions Spain were dumped out in the group stage, after just 2 games. They were thumped 5-1 by an unfancied Netherlands before suffering a 2-0 defeat at the hands of Chile. Spain only scored 4 goals in the tournament, 3 of them coming in a dead rubber against group minnows Australia. Ironically, Costa ended the tournament goalless, while the old guard, Villa and Torres both notched a goal each in the final game. For a side that tailored their style of play around short passes, a true, traditional, big and strong #9 in Costa did not quite work out well, as he was continuously booed by the Brazilian crowd, who thought that he had “betrayed” his birthplace. The Brazilian crowd joyously celebrated as Costa missed a sitter against Chile –the match that saw Spain eliminated from the tournament.</p>
<p>Yet another big tournament, yet another striker. After a torrid 15-16 season with Chelsea, Costa was dropped from the Euro 2016 squad. Alvaro Morata, who had a fruitful Champions League for Juventus, but yet used sparingly in the league, and 35-year-old AritzAduriz were preferred. Morata scored 3 goals in the group stages, but failed to have any impact in the knockout stage as Spain were eliminated after a 2-0 defeat to Italy in the Round of 16.</p>
<p>Two years later, their seemingly eternal striker dilemma seems to have come full circle. Spain have gone back to Costa, with Morata dropped. The previous incumbent, Morata, had a torrid domestic season with Chelsea &#8211; the exact position Costa found himself in, 2 years ago, after replacing him at Stamford Bridge this season. Chelsea’s club record signing at £60m,Morata couldn’t have asked for the season he had at a worse time &#8211; scoring only 11 league goals, missing a whopping 17 big chances throughout the season, and going a period of 3 months goalless at a stretch.</p>
<p>Costa, himself, hasn’t had much of a fruitful season either. Frozen out by Chelsea despite a successful 16-17 season where he powered the London club to a league title, he was sold back to Atletico Madrid. Atletico, facing a transfer ban, could not register him until January &#8211; so Costa went 6 months without top level football. Naturally rusty on return, he could only muster 3 league goals in 15 appearances. Spain’s joint-top scorer in the qualifying (with Morata), Julian Lopetegui put his faith in him again, but it remains to be seen if he can deliver on the biggest stage of all with very little football and poor form behind him.</p>

The other forwards called up, Iago Aspas, Rodrigo and Lucas Vazquez have all had respectable seasons domestically, but they are not forwards of the pedigree that will make defenders shudder in their boots &#8211; no one is quite yet established in the top tier, like Villa and Torres were back in 2010. Sergio Busquets, Andres Iniesta, Isco, Marco Asensio, David Silva, Thiago Alcantara, Koke, Saul Niguez &#8211; it reads like a who’s who of the top midfielders of today, but for Spain to have a productive World Cup, this service needs to be converted by the men upfront. It remains to be seen how Lopetegui utilizes this crop of midfielders, with the famine of a harvest up top.</p>

The previous World Cup in Brazil saw many surprises, none more so than the host nation being embarrassed 7-1 by the Germans in the semi-final. The Germans went on to win the trophy against Argentina in extra time, in what turned out to be the most expensive football match ever in terms of ticket prices, <a href="https://www.sbo.net/golden-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with some going for as much as $20,000 a seat</a>. We have taken a look some of the other fun World Cup facts:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3596 size-full" src="http://www.onlinesportson.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/world-cup-russia.jpg" alt="world cup russia" width="640" height="426" srcset="http://www.onlinesportson.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/world-cup-russia.jpg 640w, http://www.onlinesportson.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/world-cup-russia-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><strong>Stadium Distances</strong><br />
Unlike other sporting tournaments like the Olympics, the World Cup is evenly spread throughout a nation. Four years ago in Brazil, there were twelve different stadiums with distances as much as 2,000 miles between them. The journey from Porto Alegre to Fortaleza would have taken over 5 hours one way. Similarly, in Russia, the distance between Yekaterinburg in the east and Kaliningrad in the west is roughly the same distance as London to Moscow!</p>
<p><strong>3.2 Billion Viewers</strong><br />
At the last World Cup in Brazil, a truly incredibly statistic was revealed, which was that almost half of the world’s entire population tuned in to watch the event. When you consider that Brazil is widely regarded as the greatest nation to ever play the beautiful game, then it’s easy to see why. Add to that the golden generation of stars such as Messi and Ronaldo at the peak of their powers, and an England team that somehow always manages to break our hearts!</p>
<p><strong>Baby Booms</strong><br />
It has often been said that the countries that win a World Cup often experience a baby boom in the coming months. This has been noted for numerous countries who have had success in tournaments such as the French in 1998 and the Spanish in 2010. It’s even happened for countries that didn’t even win a tournament, but exceeded expectations. Nine months after Iceland’s stunning victory against England in Euro 2016, hospitals all over the Scandinavian country were suddenly more inhabited than ever before!</p>
<p><strong>3 Million Beers</strong><br />
At the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, a grand total of 750,000 litres of beer were sold at the stadiums, equating to roughly 3 million beers in total. While you may be thinking that’s one hell of a collective hangover in the morning, 390,600 hot dogs were also sold, which must have taken the edge off somewhat!</p>
<p><strong>European Dominance</strong><br />
Out of all the World Cup finals ever played, European teams have only failed to reach the final twice. European nations have won 58.8% of the finals matches that they’ve played in, and it is the Italians and the Germans who are the dominant teams on the continent with 4 titles each to their name and only 1 behind Brazil.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With a rich World Cup pedigree and a worldwide reputation for being formidable, Germany will approach Brazil 2014 amongst the favorites to win the tournament. The three-time World Cup winners remain among the highest ranked nations in world football, and have made considerable steps in recent years to preserve their dominance. Having not won a major international tournament since winning Euro ’96, Germany changed their entire football philosophy and placed great emphasis on youth production which would create many generations of world-class players. The 23-man squad which Joachim Low will put his faith in to take Germany one step further from consecutive third-placed finishes in 2006 and 2010 will illustrate the considerable wealth of top young players that is emerging from youth academies. <a title="With the German squad announced" href="http://news.coral.co.uk/world-cup/news/gomez-out-uncapped-named-preliminary-germany-roster.html" target="_blank">With the German squad announced</a>, it will be fascination to see if they live up to expectation as Europe’s greatest hope of challenging Brazil and Argentina to win the 2014 World Cup.</p>
<p><strong>Provisional squad</strong></p>
<p>As this summer’s World Cup draws ever closer, managers of the thirty-two participating nations will begin to finalize their plans and publicly announce the 23 players who will represent their country in Brazil. Germany has a vast talent pool to choose from, with a number of experienced players also available for selection in what could be their final World Cup hurrah. Many managers would love to be in Joachim Low’s shoulders in having so many world-class players at their disposal, although it has created widespread debates as to which of Germany’s young proteges are ready to play at the most prestigious tournament in football.</p>
<p>The recent announcement of Germany’s provisional 30-man squad for Brazil 2014 raised a few eyebrows, as a number of the Bundesliga’s young superstars have been preferred over experienced players who bring previous World Cup experience to the table. Joachim Low has picked a squad he believes has the right balance of experience and carefreeness from young players who are given license to express and enjoy themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Goalkeepers</strong></p>
<p>Goalkeepers may arguably be the only area which met all expectations, although Kevin Trapp and Marc-Andre Ter Stegen may feel unfortunate to be left out after enjoying excellent seasons for their respective clubs. Manuel Neuer, Roman Weidenfeller and Ron-Robert Zieler stand out at the best German keepers, with <a title="Neuer remaining one of the best in the world" href="http://www.onlinesportson.net/shalke-accepted-bayern-offer-for-neuer.html" target="_blank">Neuer remaining one of the best in the world</a> and always hits top form at major tournaments.</p>
<p><strong>Defenders</strong></p>
<p>The absence of Heiko Westermann may appear surprising, but the Hamburg defender has seriously struggled for form during a nightmare season where they will face a promotion/relegation play-off to prevent dropping out of the Bundesliga. There is no place for Dennis Aogo either, as Low has gone for Borussia Dortmund’s up-and-coming 19-year-old left back Erik Durm, Shkodran Mustafi and Matthias Ginter. They accompany Germany’s best defenders in the form of Philipp Lahm, Mats Hummels and Per Mertesacker, while the likes of Jerome Boateng, Benedikt Howedes and Marcel Schmelzer completing a hugely impressive calibre of defensive options.</p>
<p><strong>Midfielders</strong></p>
<p>Despite missing the entire season through injury, the inclusion of Sami Khedira was widely predicted as Joachim Low places great value in the Real Madrid midfielder to control the engine room. Aside from Bastian Schweinsteiger, who was nailed on to be included as one of the best midfielders in the world, Low has opted for a young midfield packed with creative flair, pace and a nerveless approach to the game which will make them a formidable force. Schalke trio Leon Goretzka, <a title="Julian Draxler and Max Meyer" href="http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/459203/Arsenal-Chelsea-miss-out-on-another-Schalke-starlet-as-Max-Meyer-says-he-s-staying-put" target="_blank">Julian Draxler and Max Meyer</a> are not only highly talented, but are poised to cap wonderful seasons by appearing at the 2014 World Cup. Another new name amongst the German ranks is Andre Hahn who has been a revelation in the Bundesliga with Augsburg, with the fastest player in Germany set to join Borussia Monchengladbach after the World Cup. Mario Gotze, Toni Kroos and Mesut Ozil were shoe-in inclusions, while Lars Bender offers defensive solidity that could be crucial against stronger nations.</p>
<p><strong>Strikers</strong></p>
<p>An excellent goal-scoring record for Germany was not enough for Mario Gomez to be called up for the 2014 World Cup, with the Fiorentina star missing out due to a lack of first-team action and missing most of the season through injury. Veteran star Miroslav Klose has, however, been included in the 30-man squad in what could be a sentimental gesture from Low to allow the 35-year-old to finish a wonderful international career in style. Klose is just two goals away from breaking Ronaldo’s all-time scoring record in World Cup tournaments – you would be hard pressed to back against Klose rolling back the years and making history. Alongside Klose will be the dangerous trio of Lukas Podolski, Marco Reus and Andre Schurrle, with Reus standing out as a striker on the very top of his game. Young prospect Kevin Volland got the nod ahead of Gomez – a decision which was well received across Germany, as the Hoffenheim starlet has excelled throughout the season and displayed a lethal touch in front of goal that could be useful at the World Cup.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The next World Cup will  be played in Brazil next year and the qualifying games are in the middle of the process.</p>
<p>Netherlands, one of the tournament favorites, are leading the group D with maximum points from five games.

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Diego Forlan</strong> born in 1970 in Montevideo is an Uruguayan international who currently plays in Primera Division for Atletico Madrid. He is two-times winner of European Golden Sho.</p>
<p><strong>Forlan </strong>began his career at Independiente. He was later transferred by Manchester United  but failed to impress.</p>
<p>The striker managed to score only 10 goals in 63 games for United unlike at Independiente where he scored 37 goals in 80 games.<br />
Forlan moved to Villareal where he regain the appetite for goals scoring 54 goals in 102 games.</p>
<p>In 2007 Forlan was transferred to Atletico Madrid for €21millions and now is one of the most feared strikers in the world one that can decide a game alone.</p>
<p>With his help Atletico Madrid won their first edition of Europa League. His goals were decisive especially in the final when he scored twice. This trophy was brought to Atletico after 40 years and also after 40 years Uruguay managed to qualify into the semifinals of the World Cup. <strong>Forlan</strong>&#8216;s goals were decisive also at the World Cup, especially the goal against Ghana in the quarter finals when he leveled the score.</p>
<p>So this &#8220;40 double&#8221;  proves to be <em>Forlan</em>&#8216;s best year a year. <strong>Forlan</strong>&#8216;s good form has not got unnoticed by Ferguson who recognized that he made a mistake when he sold him to Villareal.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span>Who says that you can’t be interested in fashion AND football? Definitely not me, and the lovely folks over at Very.co.uk have had the brilliant idea of mixing the footballing world with the fashion one, and there’s not a WAG in sight.</span></p>
<p><span>The fashion site is currently having a Very <strong>World Cup</strong> fashion face-off and they have put together a fashion look for each country playing in the World Cup that best reflects their personality and national style. The countries are then pitted against each other in the style stakes and will battle in out in the quarter finals, semi finals and then the top two will fight it out to take the crown of most stylish World Cup country.</span></p>
<p><span>England are already through to the quarter finals and you can help to decide who will join them by voting in the current fashion face-off between Brazil and Korea. Brazil have a super sexy Latin feel to their look with plenty of tropical touches and gorgeous colorful dresses, whilst Korea is represented by a strong military style with plenty of army colors, strong bold accessories and some girl touches to bring it up to date.</span></p>
<p><span>If you want to check out the <em>World Cup</em> countries styles then head over to <a href="http://very.co.uk/" target="_blank">Very.co.uk</a> to vote for your favorite style and see if you can get them through to the next round where they’ll be joining the quarter finalist so far – England, who have a festival chic look (very Kate Moss) and <strong>World Cup</strong> hosts <strong>South Africa</strong> who have a fab look including loads of animal prints in a sophisticated safari look!</span></p>
