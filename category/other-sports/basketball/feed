<p>Every year the NBA draft is followed by millions of eager basketball fans around the world, as the most promising international and college prospects are chosen. The first picks typically go to the worst teams from the previous season, within a system that is aimed at making the NBA competitive. Nevertheless, it’s also a system with some glaring flaws, which includes encouraging teams to underperform and tank, in order to get better picks.</p>



<p>Perhaps the best example of a team tanking during the 2019-20 season is the Golden State Warriors. This is the same franchise which has dominated the NBA in recent years, reaching five consecutive NBA Finals since 2015 and winning the championship three times. Now they are completely unrecognizable, rock-bottom of the Western Conference and the first team to be mathematically eliminated from playoff contention.</p>



<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aZ5n0pPX5wU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>The Milwaukee Bucks convincingly top the Eastern Conference and the Los Angeles Lakers dominate in the Western Conference, with both tipped as favorites to reach the Finals prior to the enforced break, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://extra.bet365.com/news/en/US-Sports/NBA" target="_blank">according to the NBA betting on bet365</a>, yet casual observers are unable to understand why the Golden State Warriors aren’t up there competing with them. The answer is quite simple – the Warriors are tanking to ensure they get better draft options.</p>



<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WlvU4XlGQy4" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>



<p>In the world of competitive professional sports, it might be hard to comprehend a situation whereby losing can be regarded as ultimately more rewarding than winning. However, this is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://allthingsnba.news.blog/2019/03/23/the-nba-draft-lottery-paradox/" target="_blank">the paradox created by the NBA draft system</a>. The aim of the draft is noble, for sure, because it gives the worst teams each season a chance to improve.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, it also creates a situation whereby franchises can exploit that noble aim. Since the introduction of the NBA draft Lottery, the odds are stacked heavily in favor of the worst teams for the first four picks. This means they will get the best new players entering the NBA. Ahead of the next NBA draft, the Golden State Warriors are the worst team in either conference, which means they have the joint-best odds of landing the highest-ranked players.</p>



<p>As this <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1160424-golden-state-warriors-why-the-warriors-tanking-is-hurting-the-nba" target="_blank">2012 article published by Bleacher Report highlights</a>, it’s not the first time the Warriors have looked ahead to the draft, rather than focus on winning. Back then, the way they concluded the season was called into question, apparently valuing better draft options above the prestige of competing to finish higher in the league rankings. 2019-20 results have been so bad, it seems like the Warriors are taking the same approach to a new extreme.</p>



<p>In some regards, this has created a race to the bottom where GM’s value first picks in the draft, along with the chance to sign a potential All-Star player, ahead of team performance during a season that isn’t going so well. For this reason alone, it’s clear that the draft system needs to be constantly reviewed and revised.</p>



<p>Some have suggested a completely open lottery, with no preferential order amongst teams in the draft system based around conference positions from the previous season. Perhaps this approach would discourage teams from tanking, and restore the purity of competition to the NBA, with teams aiming to perform within the best of their capabilities; rather than keep one eye on what the next draft might offer instead. However, that could take away the parity across the league that the draft seeks to enforce, so there is no clear solution, but the current system is certainly flawed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>More Americans play basketball than any other sport and the popularity of this pastime continues to grow across the country. The NBA is also watched by millions of fans around the world with countries such as Canada, Australia and China amongst the most dedicated. As a result, this 30-team league is also incredibly popular with sports bettors and with each team playing 82 times throughout the regular season, there are always plenty of opportunities to get involved. There are hundreds of markets available ahead of each and every game and we take a look at three important aspects to consider before placing a wager on the sport. </p>



<p><strong>Focus on Specific Teams and Divisions </strong></p>



<p>The average bettor is unlikely to have time to follow the fortunes of all 30 franchises and it is possible to tie yourself in knots whilst trying to keep up with every single match throughout the course of the season. With fixtures taking place most nights and teams taking to the court every couple of days, newcomers may find the sheer volume of matches extremely overwhelming.</p>



<p>It is strongly advised to choose just a handful of sides to follow, paying particular attention to team news, match reports and camp morale. If you can follow their progress on TV, this will also prove beneficial. Alternatively, you could opt to hone in on a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="particular division such as the Central Division (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.nba.com/standings/2019/division" target="_blank">particular division such as the Central Division</a> or the Pacific Division. This should allow for more in-depth analysis and subsequently result in far more informed picks.</p>



<p><strong>Be Wary of Back-to-Back Games</strong></p>



<p>Squeezing so many games into a relatively short period of time can result in teams playing back-to-back games on consecutive nights. Although this can help build up momentum, it may also prove to be a hindrance. Lack of recovery time can affect a player&#8217;s ability to perform and if a team has been involved in an energy-sapping contest, they may struggle to reach the same heights 24 hours later. This is particularly prevalent over the festive period and even the highest-ranked teams can struggle with the demanding fixture list.</p>



<p>In 2019, high-flying Miami Heat, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="who are +800 in the NBA betting (opens in a new tab)" href="https://extra.bet365.com/news/en/US-Sports/NBA" target="_blank">who are +800 in the NBA betting</a> to finish top of the Eastern Conference, saw their good form halted by a surprise defeat to the Washington Wizards. This came immediately off the back of a draining 117-116 overtime victory against the 76ers and was also their third game in four nights. Fatigue had clearly taken its toll.</p>



<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MIAvsWAS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MIAvsWAS</a>: Coach Spo calls timeout to talk this one over&#8230;<br><br>HEAT trailing the Wizards 87-69 with 4:22 remaining in the 3rd quarter. Down, but not out. <a href="https://t.co/xWfkL1u3QB">pic.twitter.com/xWfkL1u3QB</a></p>&mdash; Miami HEAT (@MiamiHEAT) <a href="https://twitter.com/MiamiHEAT/status/1211825472901914624?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>




<p><em><strong>Beware of Market Reactions</strong></em></p>



<p>Injuries are part and parcel of the game and it is highly likely that every NBA side will suffer a number of setbacks throughout the course of the campaign. The markets can react quite strongly in favor of the opposition whenever a star player picks up an injury, although it may be occasionally worth swimming against the tide. The Bucks&#8217; odds drifted following the news that superstar forward <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Giannis Antetokounmpo had picked up a back injury (opens in a new tab)" href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2868774-bucks-giannis-antetokounmpo-out-for-2nd-straight-game-due-to-back-injury" target="_blank">Giannis Antetokounmpo had picked up a back injury</a>, however, the Milwaukee outfit still won each of the two games without the Greek-born star. Most coaches will have contingency plans in place and value can often by unearthed by backing the top sides to overcome these small setbacks.</p>

<p>Successful wagering on the NBA requires substantial patience and dedication, but savvy sports bettors should still be able to find plenty of betting opportunities throughout the course of the season. Following these three tips will hopefully help keep you on the winning track and make it much simpler to follow this fantastic competition.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Last night, during the  basketball game between Houston Rockets and Charlotte Bobcats from Houston a player was taken off the field on a stretcher after suffering a concussion!<br />
After a trivial counterattack of the Rockets ended whit Chandler Parsons&#8217;s shot, a Bobcats player was lying on the floor.</p>
<p>What happened? The injured player, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, collided with his teammate Jeffrey Taylor, trying to stop Houston&#8217;s riposte. When Taylor hit Kidd-Gilchrist in the head with his knee the player crashed on the floor unconscious  and the medical stuff immobilized his neck and took him out. It seems like he spent the night at the hospital but the tomography results were not made public.</p>
