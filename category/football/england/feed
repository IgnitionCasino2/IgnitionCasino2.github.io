										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck has insisted the club will &#8220;do what they have to do&#8221; to keep Eden Hazard at Stamford Bridge amid continued speculation over the Belgian star&#8217;s future. Hazard&#8217;s current contract at Chelsea expires at the end of next season, and Real Madrid have made no secret over the fact they are monitoring the forward&#8217;s situation in London. The 27-year old has only increased speculation regarding his future by admitting it would be a <a href="http://www.espn.co.uk/football/soccer-transfers/story/3661907/chelseas-eden-hazard-real-madrid-move-remains-my-dream" target="_blank" rel="noopener">childhood dream to play for Spanish giants</a>, who themselves are looking for someone to fill the sizeable boots left by Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
<p>Hazard has started this season where he left the last, playing a key role in head coach Maurizio Sarri&#8217;s impressive start to life in England, scoring seven league goals in his first eight appearances of the campaign. On the back of a sensational couple of seasons in the Premier League, Real Madrid appear to have made the forward their number-one priority, targeting Hazard as the man to fill the gap left by Ronaldo&#8217;s departure to Juventus during the summer.</p>
<p>Chelsea&#8217;s plan to keep Hazard at the club appears to be to offer their star man a huge new contract. But, at this stage of his career, it might not be just money that motivates the Belgium international. Without Champions League football this season, Hazard&#8217;s hopes of challenging the likes of Ronaldo and Lionel Messi for the tag as the world&#8217;s best player will be tough. While it&#8217;s looking likely that Chelsea will return to European football&#8217;s elite next season, currently second in the table and as <a href="https://extra.bet365.com/news/en/football/premier-league" target="_blank" rel="noopener">short as 1/5 with the Premier League betting odds</a> to finish in the top four this year, it may not be enough to convince Hazard to stay.</p>
<p>With his contract now entering the final 18 months, Chelsea will need to know whether or not their talisman intends on staying beyond his current deal, with a huge transfer fee at stake should he be allowed to run his contract down. And when looking at world football, it&#8217;s not hard to see why Real are so keen on Hazard. Aside from Ronaldo and Messi, Hazard has a very strong case to suggest he is the best player in the world at the moment. And with the Belgian seemingly open to moving to the Bernabeu, it&#8217;s looking as though Chelsea have a real battle on their hands to keep their main man.<br />
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aVERh3FSWl8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><br />
That all said, Hazard has never come out to claim he will push for a move from the club he joined six years ago from French side Lille. While he hasn&#8217;t hidden his desire to play at the highest level, nor his respect and admiration for Real Madrid, so far, at least, Hazard has maintained a professional air regarding his future &#8211; something that perhaps <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/06/thibaut-courtois-fails-to-report-for-training-chelsea" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wasn&#8217;t the case for his compatriot Thibaut Courtois</a> in the run-up to his switch to Madrid.</p>
<p>The fact remains, however, that when Real find a player they really want to sign, it&#8217;s very rare they don&#8217;t get their man.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There have already been a number of star performers even at this early stage of the premier league season. Chelsea are the surprise package at present as punters continue to use the latest <a href="https://www.us-bookies.com/fanduel-sportsbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offer at fanduel</a> to support them for the title. Can they topple the defending champions Manchester City and the attacking powerhouses of Liverpool? Here we cover some of the stars of the season thus far.</p>
<p><strong>ALISSON &#8211; LIVERPOOL</strong></p>
<p>Liverpool’s keeper, Alisson has been a key addition to the squad. He has made a solid start to the season as the club continue to challenge for the league. At present eight games in, he is one of two keepers to have only conceded three goals. He also sits at the top of the table for saved shot percentage, so can be help them end their wait for another league title.</p>
<p><strong>JOHN STONES – MANCHESTER CITY</strong></p>
<p>It is exciting times for English football as the national team continues to go from strength to strength. They are coming off the back of a starring performance in beating Spain, and one player who is continuing to improve is <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.com/john-stones/profil/spieler/186590" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defender, John Stones</a>. The Manchester City defender is proving a revelation at the back since a stuttering start as pressure piled on him due to his big money move. He sits at the top of the interception, clearance and pass completion charts. He is set to play a leading role in their attempt to defend the premier league title.</p>
<p><strong>JORGINHO &#8211; CHELSEA</strong></p>
<p>He does not do anything flash but the impact he has on the team is unquestionable. He followed Chelsea’s new manager Sarri over from Napoli just showing the esteem he is held in. Chelsea are now renowned for the vast amount of passes they make and this is headed by the Italian. Jorginho continues to control the side from the middle and is all but set to break the premier league passing record unless an injury occurs.</p>
<p><strong>EDEN HAZARD– CHELSEA</strong></p>
<p>Another Chelsea player and the current star of the season is Eden Hazard. He kicked off the current campaign in flying form following a starring role for Belgium at the world cup in Russia. He sits at the top of the scoring charts and he really looks to be excelling from the role he is playing under new manager, Sarri. Hazard is now in talks as a future winner of the Ballon d’or but can he first help lead Chelsea to another premier league title.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Diogo Jota was one of the key players in Wolverhampton Wanderers’ impressive Championship promotion campaign last time out, and now the Portuguese youngster will have his sights set on lighting up the Premier League. The former Atletico Madrid man will be crucial in the years to come for Nuno Espirito Santo’s side, and if he can get off to a flying start in the top flight there is no telling how far this team can go.</p>
<p>The progress made at Wolves in the last year is astounding, and the Midlands club have completed some impressive player swoops thanks to their links with super-agent Jorge Mendes. Nuno’s side are a club on the rise, and this is highlighted by the fact that the newly promoted Championship winners aren’t even considered among the favourites for relegation in the season ahead. In fact, at the time of writing, with <a href="http://sports.williamhill.com/bet/en-gb/betting/y/5/Football.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all football odds</a> they can be backed at 9/1 to finish in the top six.</p>
<p>Wolves are expected to do well upon their return to the top flight due to the fact that they have some young stars in their ranks, such as Ruben Neves and Jota. Jota was the club’s top scorer last season, with 17 goals and 5 assists during his loan spell at the Molineux Stadium. Wolves were quick to make the deal <a href="http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11699/11229101/wolves-to-sign-diogo-jota-on-permanent-deal-from-atletico-madrid-at-end-of-season" target="_blank" rel="noopener">permanent</a> this summer, and it could turn out to be an incredible bit of business.<br />
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VoMtK314Rj4" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><br />
Jota began his senior career at Pacos Ferreira, where he scored 14 goals in 41 league appearances. This attracted the interest of La Liga giants Atletico, but the youngster was immediately loaned out to Porto upon his arrival at the Estadio Vicente Calderon. It was during his time with the Portuguese heavyweights that Jota began to make a name for himself as a potential future star.</p>
<p>At only 21 years old, Wolves have acquired Jota at the perfect time and can mould him into a dangerous weapon in the English top flight. The newly promoted side spent around £12 million on the winger, but this could turn out to be a bargain in today’s market. In fact, if he continues on this trajectory the Portuguese U23 international could be worth triple that in a couple of years.<br />
While Jota was one of the standout names in the lower tier last season, it isn’t always easy for players to make the step up to the top flight. Players like <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/05/18/footballs-inbetweeners-players-good-championship-cant-cut-premier/dwight-gayle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dwight Gayle</a> and Matt Ritchie have been dominant forces in the Championship in the past, but have never quite had the same effect in the Premier League. However, some do succeed. Charlie Adam and Rickie Lambert are two examples of players who managed to bring their second-tier form into the top division.</p>
<p>Wolves have a fairly tough start to their return to the Premier League and will face Everton, Leicester City, and Manchester City in their first three fixtures. In these games, Wolves may be forced to sit back and defend, but Jota could be deadly on the break. If the Portuguese can play his football against these teams, he could easily start his journey towards becoming a top-flight star.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After an impressive 2016/17 season, Manchester United took a step backwards under Jose Mourinho last campaign. The Red Devils fell short in their pursuit of silverware and fans were critical of Mourinho’s style of play. United started the season like a house on fire but their form tailed off midway through the campaign and Mourinho is now under pressure to deliver ahead of the 2018/19 Premier League season.</p>
<p>On paper, it was an ‘almost’ kind of year for United. Second to an unstoppable Manchester City side in the Premier League title race, the Red Devils secured their highest finish since lifting the title in 2013. In terms of results, there was progression but <a href="http://www.skysports.com/football/news/15115/11298831/measuring-manchester-uniteds-progress-under-jose-mourinho" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mourinho’s decision to opt for substance over style</a> did not sit well with the Old Trafford faithful. Supporters pay good money to be entertained and United were underwhelming on the whole.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">

<p>— Steve Bates (@sbates_people) <a href="https://twitter.com/sbates_people/status/998532340220612608?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 21, 2018</a></p></blockquote>
<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>United fans were angry at the manner of their Champions League last-16 defeat to Sevilla; the Red Devils were in the ascendency at Old Trafford before Mourinho attempted to shut up shop and defend a slender lead. That decision backfired as the Spanish outfit scored two quickfire goals – United suffered yet another embarrassing result on home soil. We’re not even going to talk about that FA Cup final defeat to Chelsea either…</p>
<p>Those failures have only heightened the expectations at Old Trafford ahead of 2018/19. Mourinho knows that silverware is an absolute must and the Premier League title will be United’s primary target next season – as is the case at the start of every season. As of July 2nd, <a href="https://extra.bet365.com/news/en/football/premier-league" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Red Devils are 6/1 in Premier League betting odds</a> and plenty of punters will be piling on United ahead of what could be a memorable year for the club.</p>
<p>Acting quickly in the transfer window can be the difference between success and failure – and United moved effectively to acquire Brazil midfielder Fred prior to the World Cup 2018. The former Shakhtar Donetsk star is a naturally gifted, box-to-box midfielder and his impact and influence will open up space for Paul Pogba. Fred looks destined to shine at Old Trafford and fans will be expecting big things ahead of his debut in August.<br />
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jSPAwG6IQKg" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>Mourinho’s treatment of Anthony Martial angered supporters and fans will be hoping that the Frenchman is given a fair chance this year. According to WhoScored, Martial appeared in 30 Premier League matches last season; <a href="https://www.whoscored.com/Players/122366/Show/Anthony-Martial" target="_blank" rel="noopener">although 12 of those were from the substitute’s bench</a>. In those games, the Frenchman scored nine goals whilst assisting five for his peers – some ratio considering his lack of regular time on the pitch.</p>
<p>Jose Mourinho needs to win over his critics and a Premier League title triumph is the best way to do that. Overturning the 19-point deficit to arch rivals Manchester City will be tough but United have the tools to lay down a serious challenge to Pep Guardiola’s side. With a couple of new signings before the end of the transfer window, United could be primed to regain their place at the summit of English football.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chelsea fans were in no mood for jokes and frivolities after their April Fool’s Day defeat against Tottenham Hotspur at Stamford Bridge. The 1-3 loss proved to be a decisive point in the season that left the Blues firmly outside the Premier League top four, while Spurs opened a gap of eight points above their London rivals.</p>
<p>Despite a stuttering start to the 2017-18 campaign with a frustrating defeat to Burnley at home on the opening day of the season, <a href="https://www.whoscored.com/Teams/15/Fixtures/England-Chelsea" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chelsea recovered well and suffered only three more defeats</a> in the back end of 2017, and though they have always been off the pace for the title race this season, a top-four finish almost seemed like a foregone conclusion.</p>
<p>However, just three Premier League wins in ten encounters during 2018 underlines the poor form of Conte’s side and with <a href="https://extra.bet365.com/news/en/football/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">football betting odds at 10/1 for a top-four finish</a>, Chelsea now look like they will have to settle for competing in the Europa League next season, rather than the habitual expectations of playing in the Champions League.</p>
<p><strong>Conte refuses to quit</strong></p>
<p>After winning the 2016-17 Premier League title, Conte still boasts a strong and successful coaching reputation, but throughout what has been a hugely frustrating 2017-18 campaign, his future with Chelsea has inevitably and frequently been questioned in recent months. The Italian coach himself has remained coy about discussing his position in press conferences, placing any such decision firmly in the hands of the club.</p>
<p>“We are having the season that we are deserving,” said Conte after the defeat against Tottenham, and in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/mar/31/antonio-conte-chelsea-tottenham" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comments highlighted by The Guardian</a>, he pointed towards a lack of key experience in his side. “Don’t forget in the last two or three years we lost important players for Chelsea. When you lose players with great experience and charisma and players used to winning, you lose a lot,” he suggested with reference to departed campaigners such as John Terry, Branislav Ivanovic, or Petr Cech.</p>
<p>As for whether he would remain at the helm next season, Conte continues to remain coy about his future at the club. “I don’t know, I must be honest, I don’t know. This is not my problem, it’s a problem for the club,” he concluded. That problem, should Chelsea decide to make a change before the conclusion of the season, will reportedly cost the club around £9 million, although it’s widely expected a new manager will be in charge for the start of the 2018-19 season.</p>
<p><strong>Chelsea facing a decisive summer</strong></p>
<p>It’s not just a potential managerial change that Chelsea face in the summer, particularly if the team fails to secure a place in the Champions League for next season. There are growing concerns over the futures of several important players, who are entering the final years of their contracts at the club.</p>
<p>Thibaut Courtois will be entering the final year of his deal at Stamford Bridge, and with Real Madrid in the hunt for a new goalkeeper, the Belgian shot-stopper could be lured back to the Spanish capital, following his successful stint a few years ago with Atletico Madrid. With two years left on his contract, speculation also gathers pace that <a href="http://metro.co.uk/2018/03/27/eden-hazard-will-consider-chelsea-future-world-cup-7419790/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eden Hazard could also head to the Santiago Bernabéu</a>, with Zinedine Zidane a keen admirer of the supremely talented 27-year-old.</p>
<p>Should Chelsea make their expected managerial change in the summer, any new coach will need to act quickly to ensure the best existing talent remains, with the likes of Luis Enrique and Thomas Tuchel having been touted as candidates for the post, if Conte departs. Undoubtedly, Roman Abramovic will also need to dip into his deep pockets, in order to fund what could be another big summer of spending for the London club, if they’re to be considered a genuine contender for the biggest prizes next season.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There’s very few derbies in English football that get as much hype as the North London. The first fixture between the clubs occurred in 1887, but the rivalry didn’t start until<br />
1913 when Arsenal moved their ground only 4 miles away from Tottenham’s White Hart Lane. The main objective for both teams for the remainder of the season is to secure a top 4 finish,<br />
and games like this can help the winner have a strong finish to the season.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.paddypower.com/football/euro-football/champions-league" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paddy Power football bets</a>, Tottenham are only just favourites to walk away with a win but as any football fan knows, anything can happen in a derby. Both teams have<br />
players that can heavily influence a game. Players such as Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen influence for Tottenham, whilst Arsenal’s Mesut Ozil and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang have the<br />
potential to cause huge issues to Tottenham’s defence. It is very likely that a moment of brilliance from any of these players will be the deciding factor. In celebration of the game, we’ve<br />
created this infographic which compares the form of both teams this season, and highlights some key battles on the pitch.</p>
<p>The most anticipated game this weekend is the North London Derby. Both teams are challenging for a top four finish to enter next season’s Champions League campaign. <a href="http://www.paddypower.com/football/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Football odds</a> suggest<br />
that Tottenham are the favourites. Although Tottenham are in a better position in the league, anything can happen in derbies meaning it is just as likely for Arsenal to walk away with a win. They<br />
will also be have wary about the attacking threat of Mesut Ozil, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang. This trio was part of the team that scored 5 goals against Everton, and could<br />
add more goals to their tally should Tottenham lose their concentration. Similarly, Arsenal will also have to be wary of striker Harry Kane who is one of the league’s top scorers and is dangerous<br />
in the final third of the pitch. This derby is going to be one of the most anticipated in years, and in celebration, we’ve created this special North London derby infographic.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chelsea are looking for new solutions in the attacking department in this transfer period. Antonio Conte is unhappy with the performances in the attack and wants to bring reinforcements.</p>
<p>With Alvaro Morata who alternates good matches with less good matches and Mitchy Batshuayi who did not rise to the level desired by the Italian coach, Antonio Conte has made a list with the attackers that would want at the London club.</p>
<p>The first player on the list was Fernando Llorente from Tottenham Hotspur but the other London club refused to loan the Spanish striker to their rivals. Despite the fact that Llorente is Kane&#8217;s substitute for most of the times, the Spanish striker is considered an important player for the Premier League runners up.</p>
<p>Another solution is Andy Caroll from West Ham United. The 29 years old striker is seen by Conte as a saving solution even if is a short term solution. Two other Enghish strikers that the Italian coach is interested in, somewhat surprising, are Peter Crouch and Ashley Barnes.</p>
<p>Peter Crouch from Stoke City, 37 years old, is definitely a short term solution. Even if he is a former international player with a lot of experience in Premier League, he could not be a solution for Chelsea&#8217;s future but more of a moment solution until Morata recovers to the form from 2 seasons ago when he was playing at Juventus.</p>
<p>Maybe the most surprising name on Conte&#8217;s list is Ashley Barnes. Burnley&#8217;s 28-year-old striker is basically a surprise, especially because he has scored just 4 Premier League goals this season and has played only for small teams so far.</p>
<p>The last name on the list is Edin Dzeko from AS Roma. The Bosnian player is having a good season in Serie A, compared to his best season when Manchester City payed Wolfsburg  €32 million to bring him at Etihad stadium.</p>
<p>After a less successful time at Manchester City, Dzeko managed to score 39 goals last season when he also won the top scorer title. This season The 31 years old forward has scored 13 times already.</p>
<p>The latest rumors suggest that Chelsea are ready to pay around €60 million to bring Dzeko and Ederson Palmieri at London.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Whilst the Premier League title race is beginning to look over, as Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City go from strength-to-strength, the race to join England’s elite is gathering pace in the Championship, with a host of clubs battling to get back amongst the big time for the 2018/19 campaign, which will be on us before we know it.</p>
<p>For now, it is looking like Wolverhampton Wanderers will be certainly gaining promotion back to the Premier League this season, with Nuno Espirito Santo’s side storming into a healthy lead ahead of the festive period, playing an attractive brand of attacking football, whilst mixing that with some real defensive quality.</p>
<p>The likes of Diogo Jota, Leo Bonatini and Ivan Cavaleiro have lit up the Championship with their attacking quality, and with Ruben Neves pulling the strings from central midfield, it is hard to see any of the other 23 clubs in the division stopping Wolves going forward. In defence, Willy Boly has been a man mountain, whilst John Ruddy, who arrived at Molineux as a free agent <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/39780816" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following his release from Norwich City</a>, has proved to be one shrewd addition.</p>
<p>Cardiff City are one club sat behind Wolves in the Championship table, but it is hard to imagine that Neil Warnock’s side can topple the leaders, despite surprising many by staging an unlikely promotion push. Last season, Warnock was tasked with helping the Bluebirds avoid relegation, and has now delivered on his promise of a promotion push, despite many laughing off his claims 12 months ago.</p>
<p>Whilst Cardiff’s push for promotion is a surprise, perhaps the biggest shock has been Bristol City’s fine form, which has the Robins challenging for promotion, as well as booking a place in the semi-final of the Carabao Cup. The Robins were many people’s favourites to be in a relegation battle, but Lee Johnson’s side have shown that they are up there with the best in the division, turning in some impressive displays during the first-half of the season.</p>
<p>A battling 3-3 draw with Wolves was an indication of what Bristol were all about, whilst a 2-1 victory over Cardiff in the Severnside derby was further evidence of Johnson’s side flexing their muscles in the race for promotion. Since then, the Robins have also picked up a vital three points over Sheffield United, with once again Johnson’s side taking part in a fixture with over 2.5 goals and both teams to score, just as many were predicting ahead of the fixture. Punters looking to place a bet on Championship football may want to <a href="https://www.oddschecker.com/tips/football/championship/20171205-sheffield-united-v-bristol-city-betting-tips-preview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out Oddschecker and their tips page</a> ahead of any potential wager.</p>

<p><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>
<p>Sheffield United have used the momentum they gained from last season’s promotion from League One to put themselves in this year’s Championship race, <a href="http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11683/11131266/sheffield-united-boss-chris-wilder-says-paul-coutts-appeared-to-suffer-broken-leg-in-win-over-burton" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but a broken leg suffered by Paul Coutts in November</a> has dealt the Blades a huge blow, with Chris Wilder’s side struggling since the midfielder’s injury.</p>
<p>Some of the Championship’s ‘sleeping giants’ are also in the race for promotion, with Derby County, now under the guidance of Gary Rowett, going from strength-to-strength heading into 2018. Steve Bruce is also looking to work his magic at Villa Park, with Aston Villa having aspirations of ending a brief stay in the second-tier, which has frankly become a nightmare for the club.</p>
<p>Villa have a talented squad but have struggled to gel, and the feeling around Villa Park is that not everyone is impressed with Bruce’s methods, despite his previous success at the likes of Birmingham City and Hull City in the past. Villa are looking to avoid a long stint outside the Premier League, and don’t have to look too far in the table to see a team that has become stuck outside the top-flight despite their magnitude, with Leeds United looking to end a 14-year wait for a return to the elite.</p>
<p>Leeds are well placed for a push, whilst many others will be looking to stage an assault on the top-six between now and May.</p>
<p>The title looks like it will be heading to Molineux in the Championship, but unlike many other divisions in the word, anything can happen below that, with plenty of clubs battling for promotion. Heading into 2018, there are eight, nine and maybe even 10 clubs that have the potential to gain promotion into the Premier League.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Manchester City are already looking like a formidable outfit in the Premier League, and a third title in six years could well be on the way to the Etihad Stadium, with Pep Guardiola’s side looking in irresistible form during the first half of the season, blowing opponents away with some outstanding attacking play, which has been matched by much improved defensive performances.</p>
<p>After the disappointment of last season’s third-placed finish, where City finished a mammoth 15 points behind eventual champions Chelsea, a serious assault on the Premier League title was the least expected from Guardiola’s side, particularly <a href="http://www.skysports.com/manchester-city-transfers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after another summer of high-profile arrivals</a>, as City’s squad underwent some fine-tuning.</p>
<p>It is hard to see past City picking up the Premier League title in May, with Guardiola’s squad seemingly miles ahead of the chasing pack, including city rivals, Manchester United, who are struggling to find the same style as their once noisy neighbours.</p>
<p>However, the question most City supporters will be asking is whether they can make a genuine assault on the Champions League for the first time in their history. City were beaten semi-finalists in the 2015/16 competition, with Real Madrid, eventual champions, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/may/04/real-madrid-v-manchester-city-champions-league-semi-final-live" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knocking the Sky Blues out of the competition</a> at the final hurdle before the final.</p>
<p>In this year’s competition, City have made short work of their group, with Guardiola’s side breezing through to the knockout stage of the competition with relative ease, which has left them amongst the favourites to lift the famous European trophy, <a href="https://extra.bet365.com/news/en/football/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with odds of 9/2 offered in the football betting markets</a>, with only Neymar’s PSG priced at shorter odds than the Premier League leaders.</p>
<p>City are priced at shorter odds than current holders, Real Madrid, as well as Barcelona and Bayern Munich, two of Guardiola’s former clubs. The former Barca and Bayern boss has brought a distinct style to City, which has been particularly evident this season, with Guardiola deserving of huge credit for finding a way to fit both David Silva and Kevin De Bruyne centrally into a system without his midfield finding themselves overrun. However, there are still questions as to whether City&#8217;s style will be strong enough to withstand Europe’s later stages.</p>
<p>Fernandinho is key to City’s style, sitting disciplined in front of a back four, allowing full-backs – recently Kyle Walker and Fabian Delph – freedom to get forward without leaving the side short of defensive cover. So far this season it has worked for Guardiola’s side, with the likes of De Bruyne, Silva, Raheem Sterling, Leroy Sane and Sergio Aguero or Gabriel Jesus allowed to stream forward with wave after wave of attack.</p>
<p>However, with it highly likely that some of Europe’s elite will be standing in City’s way later in the Champions League, Guardiola may have to reassess his system and find a way of giving a so far comfortable defence a little bit more protection.</p>
<p>It is looking more and more likely that Guardiola will be toasting Premier League success in May next year, but there is no doubt that City and their ambitious owners will have other ambitions in Europe. If Guardiola is to deliver in club football’s biggest competition, he might have to tighten City’s defence by sacrificing part of their free-flowing attack.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Transfer expert Guillem Balague has revealed that Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur inserted a buy-back clause when they sold Welsh international Gareth Bale to Real Madrid for a world-record fee.</p>
<p>The 28-year-old attacked joined Real Madrid for a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/sport/football/23538218" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported £85million million in the summer of 2013</a> and it has been previously reported that the North London club have first option to re-sign him.</p>
<p>In a Question and Answer on the <a href="http://www.skysports.com/football/news/12087/11135499/atletico-madrid-are-preparing-for-antoine-griezmanns-summer-exit-says-guillem-balague" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sky Sports website</a>, Balague confirmed that Spurs have first option to sign the Welshman in any future race for his signature.</p>
<p>Balague, as quoted via <a href="http://www.skysports.com/football/news/12087/11135499/atletico-madrid-are-preparing-for-antoine-griezmanns-summer-exit-says-guillem-balague" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sky Sports</a> said: “If there is any offer for Bale, Real have to contact Spurs and ask them if they want to match it.”“So yes, there is a clause.”</p>
<p>Bale developed into one of the most brilliant attacker during his four-year spell at White Hart lane, netting 26 goals and providing 15 assists both in Tottenham’s <a href="http://footballweeks.com/summary-premier-league-table-england-results-fixtures-tables-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epl fixtures</a> and across all competitions in a sensational final season at the White Hart Lane.</p>
<p><strong>Return of Gareth Bale good move for Tottenham Hotspur?</strong></p>
<p>Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino is on the record as being a firm admirer of the Welshman, who is widely regarded as one of the best to represent the Spurs. Sure, Bale has constantly been hit with injuries in the last two seasons, but his record at Bernabeu makes it clear that he is the real deal. With Real Madrid, he has won the Champions League three times and the Spanish title, scoring 70 goals and providing 55 assists across 159 matches.</p>
<p>Get the latest <a href="https://freebets.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free bets uk</a> &amp; online betting offers from leading UK bookmaker by clicking on the link.</p>
<p>Without any doubt, Bale would provide the final piece of the jigsaw in Pochettino’s young and vibrant team which has made Europe sit up and take notice with their stunning transformation.</p>
<p><strong>How ground of his move to Tottenham happening</strong></p>
<p>The price of Bale leaving Real Madrid would have to be right, and it would surely coast a whooping £60million-plus fee for such a great attacker, even one who has suffered with a lot of injuries in recent times. His next move is almost certain to be back to the Premier League and the Welshman will be not short of offers. However, he might end up joining either Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea as Tottenham cannot match the financial resources of the Manchester clubs and the West London club, but Spurs, but they can provide a grand stage, romance and a team on the up.
