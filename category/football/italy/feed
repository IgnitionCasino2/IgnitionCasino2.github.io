										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are lots of reasons to like Lazio right now: They are the top scorers in Italy’s Serie A and have, in fact, outscored most of the top teams in Europe. Their current position of third in the table puts them above their city-rivals Roma and both Milan sides, all of whom have outspent the Biancocelesti in recent times. In Simone Inzaghi, they have a young, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2018/jan/22/lazio-find-value-in-simone-inzaghi-transfers-rise-by-different-route-serie-a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exciting manager who puts entertainment and goals</a> at the forefront of his philosophy. In sum, they are a team on the up.</p>
<p>There is an <a href="http://www.legaseriea.it/en/serie-a-tim/league-table" target="_blank" rel="noopener">11-point gap between Lazio and Serie A table</a> -toppers Napoli currently however, so it may not be this season that ends their 18-year Scudetto drought. It seems though, that Inzaghi should be looking another competition to bring cheer to some long-suffering Lazio fans – the UEFA Europa League.<br />
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IWNyCf9TcJg" width="455" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Strong sides remaining in Europa League</strong></p>
<p>There is a narrative among supporters of top clubs that states the Europa League is easy to win should your side give it priority. While there is some modicum of truth in this idea, it is not always the case. Indeed, this season’s Europa League knockout stages arguably the greatest concentration of top sides in recent memory: Atlético Madrid, Arsenal, Borussia Dortmund and Napoli all see themselves as worthy of being in the <a href="http://www.onlinesportson.net/who-will-win-champions-league-in-2018.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latter stages of the Champions League</a>, rather than in UEFA’s secondary competition.</p>
<p>Joining those four heavyweights are several other sides who will undoubtedly fancy their chances of making the final in Lyon on 16th May, including AC Milan, Lyon, Villareal, Atalanta, RB Leipzig and, of course, Lazio. The tournament really is stacked with great teams. In terms of betting odds, Atlético <a href="https://sports.betway.com/en/sports/cat/soccer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are currently 4/1 favourites with Betway Sport</a>, with Arsenal not far behind at 11/2. Dortmund and Napoli are both available at 10/1, but it is Lazio, available at a generous 16/1 with Betway, who really look like the value bet.</p>
<p>Lazio have been given a decent draw in the round of 32, taking on Steaua Bucharest with the first leg in Romania on 15th February. The quirks of the draw have been kind to Lazio too, with Borussia Dortmund v Atalanta, Lyon v Villareal and Napoli v Leipzig ensuring that three of the teams they consider to be rivals will be out of the Last 16.</p>
<p>Some circumstances will, of course, have to continue to fall in the right manner for Lazio. Ciro Immobile, who has looked a player reborn since returning to Italy, must continue his impressive form in front of goal. Inzaghi must also find ways to shore up a porous defence, which could prove a painful deficiency in the latter stages of the competition. The <a href="http://www.espn.com/espn/wire/_/section/soccer/id/22003042" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent signing of Uruguayan international Martin Cáceres</a> will undoubtedly help with that though.</p>
<p><strong>Immobile’s goals have helped Lazio soar</strong></p>
<p>The most crucial aspects for Lazio may just be that they are on of the form sides in Europe at the moment and, unlike Serie A rivals Napoli, they will not be concentrating on a title race. Simone seems to be building a brilliant side out of loan players, misfits and journeymen, but they are fabulous to watch in action and could cap it off with a European trophy in May.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>SSC Napoli is one of the most successful clubs in Italian football with two Serie A trophies,five Coppa Italia and two Italian Supercoppa. On the European stage they have only one trophy, the Uefa Cup in 1988-1989 season.</p>
<p>According to Uefa rankings from this year, Napoli are ranked as the 8th club in European football and 2nd club in Serie A. This performance is even greater, considering that they are in front of clubs like Chelsea or Paris Saint-Germain and after they were only on 106th position in 2010-2011 season. The club is also in top 20 most valuable clubs in the world, on seventeen place with a value of around $350 million.</p>
<p>Last season, Napoli were close to win the Serie A as they fought for the trophy with Juventus. In the end they finished only 2nd at 9 points behind Juventus. But the title was not won so easily by Juventus. Both clubs were close in the standings but in the end Napoli made a few wrong steps. Even so this is a good performance that allows them to play in the next edition of Champions League, which will bring nice profits to the club.</p>
<p>After last season success the fans are hoping that their favorites will win the Serie A this year and according to <a href="https://www.betfaircasino.com/" target="_blank">www.betfaircasino.com</a> they have a good chance to do it. Anyway the things have not started so well for the fans as their star, Gonzalo Higuain was sold to their rivals Juventus. Higuain scored 36 goals in 35 games for Napoli last season.</p>
<p>Even if they received €90 million, which will be paid in two trances, the loss is very important because the Argentinian was decisive with his goals in many games. The fans were very upset that the striker decided to leave San Paolo for Juventus as they know that a player like Gonzalo Higuain is very hard to be replaced, but they are convinced that the board will find the best solution.</p>
<p>Mauro Icardi from Inter and Diego Costa from Chelsea were on the shortlist but in the end it was Arkadiusz Milik from Ajax Amsterdam for €34 million who arrived at San Paolo. Also in this summer were brought defender Lorenzo Tonelli from Empoli for €10 million, midfielder Emanuele Giaccherini from Sunderland for €1.5 million and Polonaise  midfielder Piotr Zielinski from Udinese for €16 million.</p>
<p>When things seemed to have cooled down, there were rumors that suggest that another important playerit is very close to leave the club. It seems that Chelsea Londra are decided to buy the Senegalese defender Kalidou Koulibaly and they are prepared to make a bid around €70 million, an offer that is hard to refuse especially for a defender.</p>
<p>Napoli are also interested on Simone Zaza from Juventus and they are prepared to make an offer of around €25 million for the Italian striker.</p>
<p>Everybody is curios how Maurizio Sarri will manage to motivate the players to fight for the title after so many changes in the team. It&#8217;s very important how long will take for the new players to adapt to the new team and new style. Can Napoli win the Serie A? It&#8217;s to early to say that, but surely they will be a strong team.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gonzalo Higuain is one of the most in form strikers at the moment and at the same time one of the most wanted players.</p>
<div id="attachment_2065" style="width: 455px" class="wp-caption alignleft"><a href="http://www.onlinesportson.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/higuain.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2065" class="size-medium wp-image-2065" src="http://www.onlinesportson.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/higuain.jpg" alt="Higuain" width="445" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-2065" class="wp-caption-text">Higuain</p></div>
<p><a href="https://www.guts.com/en/page/PremierLeagueMatches" target="_blank">Premier League betting odds explained</a> that Arsenal, Chelsea or PSG are among the possible destinations for the 28 years old star.</p>
<p>Arsenal were interested in signing Higuain also in 2013 but the Argentine forward chose Napoli in the end.</p>
<p>Arsenal failed to score in nine games this season and it&#8217;s clear that they need to strengthen the attack. Olivier Giroud is the only natural striker as Danny Welbeck, Theo Walcott or Joel Campbell are comfortable playing on the wings.</p>
<p>Even if Giroud is in good form, Arsenal still need at least one more star attacker if they want to be competitive on all the fronts. Also a partnership with Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil could prove deadly for any Premier League side.</p>
<p>On the other hand PSG would need a replacement for Zlatan Ibrahimovic who&#8217;s contract expires at the end of the season. Ibrahimovic will probably leave the French capital this summer. The Swedish star is still a first team regular but latest injuries may suggest that he is not the player that used to be.</p>
<p>The rumors from Serie A suggest that Higuain will not sign a new deal with Napoli. The striker was recently called out by Napoli president for being overweight and the Argentine has not taken lightly. On the other hand the player&#8217;s agent,  Nicolas Higuain, stated that the he will not leave this summer. The current contract expires in 2018.</p>
<p>Pipita joined Napoli from Real Madrid in the summer of 2013 for €40 millions. Even if he won Coppa Italia in the first season Higuain had ups and downs during the first two seasons in Serie A. This season is definitely his best in Serie and not only. The Argentine forward is currently the Serie A top goalscorer, with 25 goals in 27 games.</p>
<p>Napoli are currently second in Serie A standing, 3 points behind Juventus. For the first time in the last couple of years Napoli have real chances of winning the Serie A title. Napoli have won the title only two times in 1986 -1987 and 1989-1990 seasons spurred on by their talismatic captain Diego Maradona.</p>
<p>Gonzalo Higuain declared himself delighted with how thins are going this season. He mentioned that one of the reasons for his good form is the relation with coach Maurizio Sarri.</p>
<p>Gonzalo Higuain started his career at River Plate youth team. He made the debut in the first team in 2005. In two seasons he scored 13 goals in 35 appearances before moving to Real Madrid.</p>
<p>Higuain scored 25 goals in 54 appearances for Argentina according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sports_betting" target="_blank">wikipedia</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The opening weekend of the new Serie A season produced a shock result as champions Juventus were beaten 1-0 at home at Udinese.</p>
<p>While it would be unwise to make knee-jerk reactions to the defeat and what it means for the rest of the season, it certainly raises the question as to whether Juventus are vulnerable this season. And, if so, which team are most likely to capitalise?</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-450" title="pirlo" src="http://www.onlinesportson.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/pirlo.jpg" alt="pirlo" width="450" height="300" /></p>
<p class="wp-caption-text">by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/people/drabikpany/" target="_blank">DrabikPany</a></p>
<p>The defeat by Udinese was the first time Juventus had lost in the league in Serie A since January 2013. It was also only the sixth time in 48 games at home that they had actually failed to win. It’s certainly not a defeat that’s going to <a href="http://www.bet365.com/news/en/betting/football/serie-a" target="_blank">dent odds in the region of 8/11 for the title in the Serie A betting</a>. But it’s a defeat which does suggest this season is going to be more difficult for Massimiliano Allegri’s side.</p>
<p>Since finishing last season 17 points clear of Roma for the second year in a row, Allegri has seen several key players leave the club from important positions.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.espnfc.com/story/2514095/andrea-pirlo-joins-new-york-city-fc-from-juventus" target="_blank">Andrea Pirlo’s decision to head to Major League Soccer</a> has left Juventus shorn of tremendous experience and influence in midfield. There was certainly no sign last season that age was catching up with the 36-year-old and his ability to dictate the tempo will be sorely missed. Sami Khedira is a fine defensive midfielder, but he has different qualities to Pirlo.</p>
<p>Seeing Arturo Vidal go to Bayern Munich has also taken even more quality out of Juventus’ midfield, while Carlos Tevez has returned to Argentina to join Boca Juniors and his spirit, along with goals, will be a huge loss. Paulo Dybala and <a href="http://www.juventus.com/en/news/news/2014/mandzukic-joins-juventus.php" target="_blank">Mario Mandzukic</a> have the potential and pedigree to score goals, but it’s going to be a major challenge for them to replicate the attitude of Tevez.</p>
<p>At the moment, it is certainly debatable whether the players Juventus have signed are equal to those they have lost, never mind improvements. It’s going to take time for the new signings to settle into the squad and the style Allegri plays, and that’s why it would be silly to think Juventus shouldn’t still be considered as title favourites.</p>
<p>But it will certainly give their title rivals hope and perhaps the club who could be in the best position to profit from any decline in Juventus’ standards are Inter Milan.</p>
<p><img class="size-medium wp-image-450" title="stadium" src="http://www.onlinesportson.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/stadium.jpg" alt="stadium" width="450" height="300" /></p>
<p class="wp-caption-text">by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/people/batrace/" target="_blank">Batrax</a></p>
<p class="wp-caption-text">Roberto Mancini knows what it takes to construct a title-winning team from his first spell as Inter coach and there is a lot to like about their summer transfer business.</p>
<p class="wp-caption-text">Mancini looks to have seriously improved Inter’s defence from last season, with the likes of Miranda and Jeison Murillo coming into the squad and was rewarded with a clean sheet in the opening game against Atalanta.</p>
<p class="wp-caption-text">A 1-0 win at home over Atalanta thanks to a 93rd minute goal from Stevan Jovetic isn’t the sort of result which will get you excited about Inter’s title chances. But that is exactly the type of game Inter would have drawn 0-0, or even lost, last season. With the addition of Jovetic, and <a href="http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11675/9965015/inter-milan-open-talks-with-tottenham-for-erik-lamela" target="_blank">potentially Erik Lamela as well</a>, Inter will have talented attacking players who know Serie A well.</p>
<p class="wp-caption-text">Making up 32 points on Juventus from last season would be a monumental achievement, but the blocks are in place for Inter to be the biggest dangers to the reigning champions.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Cristian Chivu has decided to hang up his boots after a successfully career. The Romanian international who started his career at Resita has not played a game since 2013.</p>
<p>The versatile defender suffered a few finger surgeries in the last two years but the recovery was not as expected.</p>
<p>Chivu came at Inter in 2007 from AS Roma. Under Jose Mourinho he played the best football of his career and won the treble in 2010. The 33 years old defender career could have been longer but the injuries have stopped him from playing anymore.</p>
<p>The former Ajax captain declared that he is proud of what he achieved during his career and wanted to thank all the coaches and all of his former colleagues for the support.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Antonio Di Natale has saddened the fans after announcing that he will retire at the end of the season. The 36 years old forward declared that this season will be the last one.</p>
<p>The Italian international started his youth career at Empoli and made the debut to the senior team in 1996.  He played for them until 2004 and during that time he was loaned for 3 consecutive seasons to other teams.</p>
<p>In 2004 Empoli relegated and he moved to Udinese. The gifted attacker scored only 7 goals in his first season at Udinese. He improved the goal ratio every season and in 2007 was named captain. 2010 was his best season when he manged to score 29 goals and became Serie A top scorer. He managed to win the Serie  A top scorer trophy also next year with 28 goals. Di Natale played a massive role to Udinese first qualification for the Champions League in 2004-2005 season.</p>
<p>The Italian striker has scored only 4 goals this season and according to <a title="Tropezia Palace" href="http://www.casinoenligneclub.net/tropezia-palace" target="_blank">Tropezia Palace</a> has very small chances of winning the top goalscorer trophy this year.</p>
<p>Di Natale is undoubtedly the most loved Udinese player in the last decade. The fans will surely remember his goals for the next couple of years. The Italian scored 189 goals in 362 games for Udinese and 11 goals in 42 appearances for Italy.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>AS Roma  have confirmed that they reached an agreement over extending Francesco Totti&#8217;s deal with two years. The Italian striker&#8217;s contract was about to expire next year and the club decided to add two more years to the contract.</p>
<p>Totti declared that he is delighted with the new deal and that it is something that both parts wanted. He also wanted to thank the president for offering him the opportunity to finish his career at his beloved club. Unlike Juventus or Real Madrid, Roma decided to hold on on their captain and offer him a new contract.</p>
<p>Even if Totti is 36 already he is still an important player for Roma, and the statistics prove that. His recent form added him into consideration for Italy&#8217;s squad.</p>
<p>Totti made Roma debut in 1992 and since then he won Serie A, Coppa Italia and Supercoppa Italiana.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Keisuke Honda is one of the best  and also one of the most wanted Japanese players.</p>
<p>Honda&#8217;s contract at CSKA Moscow will expire at the end of December and the player will leave for another championship. The 27 years old midfielder already declared that he will move from Russia at the end of his contract.</p>
<p>AC Milan tried to sign Honda this summer but the clubs have not reach to an agreement over the transfer sum. Milan proffered to not spend too much on the Japanese midfielder knowing that they might be able to take him for free in about six months.</p>
<p>But the player declared that he might not join Milan as there are more interested clubs. Kaka&#8217;s arrival at Milan might also influence his decision as they both share the same position.</p>
<p>Honda started his professional career at Nagoya Grampus in 2005. In 2007 moved to VVV-Venlo where he played two years before moving to CSKA.</p>
