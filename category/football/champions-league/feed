<p>Latest rumors from Spain suggest that Real Madrid are prepared to offer up to €350 million to sign Neymar from PSG. Also they are willing to make him the best paid football player by offering him € 45 million per season.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.onlinesportson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/real-madrid-stadium.jpg" alt="Santiago Bernabeu" class="wp-image-3668" srcset="http://www.onlinesportson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/real-madrid-stadium.jpg 800w, http://www.onlinesportson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/real-madrid-stadium-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.onlinesportson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/real-madrid-stadium-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption>Santiago Bernabeu</figcaption></figure>



<p>After winning three consecutive Campions League titles, Real Madrid have one of the worst seasons. They were eliminated from Champions League, Spainish Cup, and 15 points behind their rivals from Barcelona in LaLiga standings.</p>



<p>Real have scored only 43 goals in 26 games this season, and it looks like Ronaldo&#8217;s departure was a bad decision. Ronaldo joined Juventus last summer after failing to reach another agreement with the board. The transfer sum was around €112 million. Also Zidane&#8217;s decision to leave the club affected the players morale.</p>



<p>Another possible reason for this disastrous season might be the players age. Most of the starting line-up players are above 30 years old, and some of them have passed their best.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why Real Madrid will probably invest massively this summer, and Neymar is their main target. Kylian Mbappe is also on their list but is believed that the French star will be harder to convince to leave his country.</p>



<p>Of course some players will also leave Bernabeu. Bale, Isco, Kroos, Marcelo are the first names on the list but not only.</p>



<p>One thing is sure,Real Madrid will have to spent big  if they are willing to return to winning days.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Travelling across Europe to watch your favourite team play in the Champions League is never a cheap venture, but the amount can vary massively depending on the group stage draw.</p>
<p>This season Manchester City, Liverpool, Tottenham and Manchester United are all competing in Europe’s premier tournament, in the hope that they can propel English club football back to the top.</p>
<p>Manchester City are the current favourites to win the tournament and according to <a href="https://www.betfair.com/exchange/plus/football/competition/228" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Champions League betting</a>, they are 9/2, just ahead of Barcelona who are 5/1.</p>
<p><strong>Manchester City</strong></p>
<p>Despite being the favourites, City lost their opening game, as Lyon stunned the Premier League champions, winning 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium.</p>
<p>City have also travelled to their other two group stage opponents, Hoffenheim and Shakhtar Donetsk and picked up maximum points, renewing their hope of winning a first Champions League title.</p>
<p><strong>Liverpool</strong></p>
<p>The Reds finished as the runners-up in last season’s Champions League, losing out to Real Madrid in the final. This season, they have been drawn against Serie A runners-up Napoli, Ligue 1 winners PSG and Serbian SuperLiga winners Red Star Belgrade.</p>
<p>Liverpool have played one away match so far, a trip to Naples to take on Napoli, a match in which they lost in the dying minutes thanks to a goal from Lorenzo Insigne. Their fans still have trips to Paris and Belgrade to look forward to.</p>
<p><strong>Tottenham Hotspur</strong></p>
<p>When Spurs fans watched the draw for the Champions League group stage this season, alarm bells began to ring as they were drawn against Barcelona, Inter Milan and PSV Eindhoven.</p>
<p>Having failed to win so far, losing away to Inter Milan and at home to Barcelona and then drawing away to PSV, Tottenham’s hopes of reaching the knockout phase have been severely dented. Although Spurs fans have arguably the easiest away trips with regards to journey times, that will be of little comfort given their current form in Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Manchester United</strong></p>
<p>Jose Mourinho has endured a poor start to his third season in charge of Manchester United. The Red Devils currently lie in 8th place in the Premier League and haven’t fared much better in Europe, winning only one of their opening three Champions League matches, away to BSC Young Boys.</p>
<p>United still have to travel to Valencia and Turin before knowing their final position within the group. These away trips will see the Red Devils face a struggling Valencia and a Juventus team who have former United star Cristiano Ronaldo at their disposal.</p>
<p>The infographic below examines the price the English fans must pay to watch their team away in the Champions League.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>European football’s night of nights is upon us once again as we get ready to watch Liverpool and Real Madrid battle it out in the Champions League final. It promises to be a spectacular event with both teams having an extremely successful history in the competition. The match will be played in Kiev, Ukraine, at the NSC Olimpiyskiy Stadium in front of a fully packed house of 70,000 fans.</p>
<p>Real have won the tournament a record 12 times and are the reigning champs after <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jun/03/juventus-real-madrid-champions-league-final-match-report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defeating Italian side Juventus 4-1</a> in Cardiff last year. It was the first time a club had won consecutive titles and their third Champions League title in four years.</p>
<p>Liverpool also have a rich history in the league, having won five titles with the last being back in 2005 against AC Milan. The Reds came back from a 3-0 deficit at half-time to stun the Italian giants and push the game to penalties. Some superb goalkeeping from Jerzy Dudek and a cool head from Liverpool’s penalty takers ensured that the coveted trophy returned back to Anfield once again.</p>
<p>This year’s final is expected to be a high scoring affair with Liverpool being the competition’s highest-scoring side with 40, and Madrid in second on 30. The Spanish giants will go into the match as favourites at 6/5 though, with the Reds currently 21/10 according to <a href="http://sports.williamhill.com/bet/en-gb/betting/t/344/UEFA Champions League.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this link</a> at William Hill’s betting website.</p>
<p>The tournament’s all-time leading goal scorer, Cristiano Ronaldo, is the bookmakers&#8217; choice to draw first blood at 3/1, and will be a major attacking threat for Real having scored 15 goals already in the competition. The Portuguese superstar is not only magnificent during normal play, but has one of the most lethal boots in world football when it comes to free kicks. The key for the English side will be to shut Ronaldo out of the game as much as possible, forcing Madrid to use their other attacking options instead.</p>
<p>Liverpool however, have a much more even spread when it comes to their key forwards, with the fantastic trio of Mohamed Salah, Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mane tearing apart team’s defences on their way to the final. Salah and Firmino lead the way for the English side with an impressive ten goals apiece, with Mane right behind them scoring nine.</p>
<p>Although Liverpool are the underdogs heading into the match, the ability to score goals from a range of different positions is sure to cause a few headaches for the Madrid defence. Their midfield has also played a large part in the journey to Kiev, with James Milner leading the competition for assists with nine.</p>
<p>Stopping Ronaldo is the key if the Reds have any chance of lifting the trophy and it looks like they may have had some help from Liverpool’s football gods. Cristiano picked up an ankle injury in the recent 2-2 Classico draw against fierce rivals Barcelona, and some football experts think it <a href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/701740/Cristiano-Ronaldo-injury-latest-Real-Madrid-Liverpool-news-Champions-League-final" target="_blank" rel="noopener">may be more serious</a> than the club is letting on. Madrid will feel that they have to start him but it could prove costly if he aggravates the injury and needs to be substituted. It would surely open the game wide open and Liverpool’s offensive style could see the momentum shift the English side’s way.</p>
<p>Will the Spanish side continue its dominance in Europe or are the glory days about to return to Anfield? In a few short weeks, we will have the answer to the question on every football fan’s lips. It’s going to be a sensational night of football as spectators from all over the world tune in to see who will be crowned the champions of Europe.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Champions League reaches the semi-finals stage this week, with two mouth-watering ties scheduled to be played on Tuesday and Wednesday.</p>
<p>Liverpool and Roma go head-to-head in the first leg of their tie on Tuesday, while Bayern Munich and Real Madrid meet the following day. The return legs are set to take place on May 1 &amp; 2.</p>
<p>Read on as we preview both semi-final ties.</p>
<p><strong>Liverpool vs Roma</strong></p>
<p>Liverpool haven&#8217;t won the Champions League since 2005, but their quarter-final victory over <a href="http://www.onlinesportson.net/assessing-manchester-citys-champions-league-assault.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly-fancied Manchester City</a> raised hopes that they could end that barren run.</p>
<p>However, Roma&#8217;s second leg performance against Barcelona in the previous round showed that it would be foolish to underestimate them.</p>
<p>The Serie A side were beaten 4-1 by Barcelona in the first leg of their quarter-final tie, but they battled back in the return game to win 3-0 and progress to the last four on away goals.</p>
<p>The Reds are priced at 2/5 with <a href="http://www.xn--q3cb0a2acc6bd4m.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bet365</a> to qualify for the final, with Roma available at 7/4.</p>
<p>Liverpool comfortably progressed through the group stages without losing a game, and they have seen off both Porto and Man City in the knockout rounds.</p>
<p>Roma finished top of their group above Chelsea and Atletico Madrid in the first stage and their subsequent victories over Shakhtar Donetsk and Barca will give them confidence that they can defeat Liverpool.</p>
<p>Mohamed Salah continued his superb form for Liverpool with his 41st goal of the season at West Bromwich Albion in the Premier League on Saturday and he is priced at 11/5 to score two or more goals on Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>Bayern Munich vs Real Madrid</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://fcbayern.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bayern Munich</a> face holders Real Madrid in the last four of the Champions League aiming to reach the final for the first time since 2013.</p>
<p>Bayern booked their place in the semi-finals with a 2-1 aggregate success against Sevilla, while Real needed Cristiano Ronaldo&#8217;s last minute penalty to see off Juventus 4-3 overall.</p>
<p>The German club are priced at Evens to progress to the final, with Madrid on offer at 3/4.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Lat year Real Madrid managed to be the first team in football history who wins two consecutive Champions League trophies. Even if Real Madrid have won the Champions League title in the past two years, they remain the main favorites to win the Champions League again according to <a href="http://newcasinoonline.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new online casinos 2018</a>.</p>
<p>Zinedine Zidane managed to create an extraordinary group at Madrid and Real remain the main favorite this year too. PSG are the second favorites according to <a href="http://casino-bonus.com/new-casino-sites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new casino sites 2018</a>. The French giants where not even on top five favorites last year but the signings of Neymar from Barcelona and Mbape from Monaco moved them up in the list of favorites.</p>
<p>Bayer Munchen are the third favorites ti win Champions League 2018. The German giants were among the favorites to win the trophy every year but they were not able to reach the final since the season 2012-2013 when they won the trophy after a final with Borussia Dortmund.</p>
<p>The fourth favorite are FC Barcelona. The Spanish team have the chance to repair their image after a disastrous ending last season. Even if they suffered a big loss after Neymar move to Paris SG, the new signings have demonstrated so far that they are capable to replacing the Brazilian striker.</p>
<p>Manchester City, Manchester United, Chelsea London, Atletico Madrid, Juventus Torino, Liverpool or Tottenham are the other contenders but the experts from <a href="https://casinoonline.casino/new-casino/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new casino 2018</a> believe that it will be a big surprise if any of them will win the trophy next year.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>For those who have been living under a rock, the UEFA Champions League is the most watched sporting event in the world (and the competition where a lot of <a href="http://www.paddypower.com/football" target="_blank" rel="noopener">football betting</a> takes place), and last year was one of the most exciting competitions to date.</p>
<p>We look back at the largest football competition in the world by looking at what the players have been doing on the pitch. We’re not looking at the number of goals, attempts, corners or red card. No, were looking at the possible number of miles run, calories burned, drink consumed and half time oranges eaten in each game of football and in the entire season.</p>
<p><strong>Miles Ran</strong></p>
<p>Football is both a physically and mentally demanding, with a game lasting 90 minutes, but can go on for 120 minutes if extra time is added. A maximum of 18 players on a pitch running up and down a pitch with a ball almost constantly in play and can travel great distances in a matter of seconds, you could imagine the players gaining some mileage running back and forth.</p>
<p>Naturally, we cannot assume that every football player will be travelling the same amount during a 90 minute game, or in fact be on the pitch for the whole game. However, it is not uncommon for a football player to travel an average of <strong>seven miles</strong> per game. Some football tracking data has also clocked some players moving up to <strong>nine and a half miles</strong> in a 90 minute game.</p>
<p>If the maximum number of players*1on a pitch were traveling the same distance (7 miles), then they would be travelling<strong> 154 miles</strong>. That’s the equivalent of running the London Marathon <strong>6 times</strong> in 90 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Calories Burned</strong></p>
<p>According to Harvard Health Publications, football players who weigh between 155lbs and 185lbs burn approximately 285 calories whilst playing 30 minutes of football. This rate is similar to the playing tennis, badminton or ice skating.</p>
<p>However, it would be unwise to assume that every footballer will be doing the same level of exercise or, in fact, be on the pitch for a whole 90 minute game, therefore, the overall figure cannot be simply tripled to make a final amount.</p>
<p>If the maximum number of players on a pitch*1 burned off the same amount of calories whilst playing 90 minutes of football they could potential burn off between <strong>over 855 calories.</strong></p>
<p>One of the top teams to get through to the last rounds in the Championship will have played in excess of 10 games. Any one player who plays more than ten games during the season will have burnt over 8,550 calories the equivalent to 22 bowls of plain pasta or 28 cheese burgers.</p>
<p><strong>Stay hydrated – drink lots of fluids</strong></p>
<p>Football is a strenuous sport and requires a lot of physical stamina, therefore, it is vital to be properly hydrated in order to maintain peak performance and reduce the risk of injury.</p>
<table style="height: 188px;" width="543">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td width="141"><strong>Amount of fluid</strong></td>
<td width="246"><strong>When?</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="141">600ml</td>
<td width="246">Two hours before the match starts</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="141">500ml</td>
<td width="246">15 minutes before the match starts</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="141">100-150ml</td>
<td width="246">Every 15 minutes during the match</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="141">1000ml</td>
<td width="246">During half time</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>It is estimated that a football player should drink between 2.7 litres and 3 litres of water/fluids during a football match. This figure is formed by a football player consuming 600ml two hours before a match, 500ml 15 minutes before a match, between 100ml and 150ml every 15 minutes during a football match and 1litre during half time.</p>
<p>If the maximum number of players on a pitch*1 consumed the same amount of water/fluids during a match in UEFA Champions league then a total of 66 litres would be consumed per match by all the players combined, that equates to 20,658 litres the equivalent over 36,000 pints! If you place the pint glasses on top of one another this would be 6 times the height of the Burj Khalifa, the world’s tallest building at 828-metres high!</p>
<p><strong>Half Time Oranges</strong></p>
<p>Who remembers the good old half-time orange? According to long standing football wisdom, there was no better snack than an orange wedge. They are a healthy, easy to eat snack, loaded with vitamin C which helps to boost energy as well as carbohydrates, giving football players a fuel boost and more stamina. They also help you stay hydrated because they have a high water content.</p>
<p>To make the most of what you had on the grounds, oranges would be cut up into six individual segments. If we apply this today football players in the UEFA League, with the maximum number of players on a pitch*1 eating two orange segments, then during the tournament from start to finish the players would get through 2,295 oranges!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many players are opting for another snack and this tradition has become outdated and could soon be relegated to the history books as they lack electrolytes. They can also cause stomach issues as they contain fructose. No football player would want to have to pop out for “a moment” during the second half.</p>
<p><em>Sources: The number of miles ran is an estimation and sourced from askascientisht.co.uk. Number of Calories Burned is from a publication by the Harvard Health. The number of litres of water/fluids have been sourced from BBC Sport. Number of oranges consumed is based on the scenario of each footballer consuming two orange segments.</em><br />
<em>Based on a total of 11 players in each team playing at any one time for 90 minutes. Total number of games played from the start to the end of the UEFA Championships is estimated to be 313.</em><br />

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a thrilling 2013/14 Champions League which saw Real Madrid capture “La Decima” (their tenth European cup) betting interest is very high in this seasons competition.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Champions League Outright</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Prediction – Real Madrid 4/1</span></p>
<p>The defending champions are even better this year with the additions of Rodriquez and Kroos, two of the World cup’s best performers. A combination of quality and confidence means Madrid are the strongest team in the competition. 4/1 represents surprisingly good value.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Competition – Bayern Munich 4/1, Barcelona 5/1</span></p>
<p>Munich haven’t strengthened a whole lot, and their mauling at the hands of Madrid in last year’s competition is unlikely to give them much confidence if the two meet again.</p>
<p>A team consisting of Messi, Neymar, Suarez, and Iniesta means Barcelona will always be contenders. Their calamity defence will likely prove their downfall once again however.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Value Bet – PSG – 14/1</span><br />
A star studded, yet in-consistent team. At their best they are as good as anyone and are always likely to unveil a new star addition before the transfer window shuts, which willinevitably see their oddsplummet. Many French punters will be using <a href="http://vegascasinofrancais.fr" target="_blank">http://vegascasinofrancais.fr</a> to place their bets.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Top Goalscorer</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Prediction – Lionel Messi 5/1</span></p>
<p>2013/14 was a disappointing year for Messi. He only scored 41 goals. World Cup heartache will likely motivate <a href="http://www.biography.com/people/lionel-messi-555732" target="_blank">Messi</a> to prove once more that he is the world’s best player, as he should just pip Cristiano Ronaldo to the top goal-scoring post. At 5/1 he is also much better value than Cristiano.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Competition – Cristiano Ronaldo 7/2 &#8211;</span></p>
<p>Last year’s top goal scorer is the obvious threat to Messi. His odds of 7/2 do look short however, and you can usually find better odds when playing <a href="http://www.pokiesheaven.com.au/" target="_blank">pokies at pokiesheaven.com.au</a></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Value Bet – Sergio Aguero 14/1-</span></p>
<p>If Aguero can regain full fitness, he is likely to be a real contender for the title. With Manchester City playing a much more attacking brand of football, and with playmaker David Silva behind him, 14/1 looks outstanding value.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Top English Team</span></strong></p>
<p><strong>Chelsea – 7/4 –</strong></p>
<p>Strongest defence, and have the best manager in the competition, but will still struggle to score against the very best.</p>
<p><strong>Manchester City – 15/8 –</strong> Have the best strength in depth, and look the best bet to go far.</p>
<p><strong>Arsenal – 10/3 –</strong> Much improved team from previous years but still lack the mental toughness to go further than their counterparts.</p>
<p><strong>Liverpool – 9/2</strong></p>
<p>Will sorely miss Suarez as an ageing Gerrard will not be enough to carry them. Look very poor value at 9/2.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Losing the Premier League title into the city rivals favor and the Champions League disastrous campaign haven&#8217;t gone without consequences at Manchester City. The first victim was Roberto Mancini who was sacked by City&#8217;s board.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not all as the English giants have started the transfer campaign with two big signings in order to increase their chances of winning the title next season. According to betting odds Manchester United are still the favorites to win the Premier League next season. Until then you can check the <a title="daily naps" href="http://betting.betfair.com/horse-racing/horseracing-tips/" target="_blank">daily naps</a> for some horse racing tips.</p>
<p>Fernandinho signing came just a few days after Jesus Navas arrival. The Brazilian midfielder has cost City €40 millions and he signed a four years deal with the club.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s well known that City is used to pay more than other clubs to get the players they want but €40 millions is a big sum even for them. That&#8217;s why some of their fans have started to put questions about the transfer.</p>
<p>Fernandinho played only for Shakhtar Donetsk in Europe and that&#8217;s why he is a new figure for most of the fans. Also he has made only five appearances for Brazil squad due to the same reason. Even if <a title="Shakhtar dominated the Ukraine league" href="http://www.soccerway.com/teams/ukraine/joint-stock-company-fc-shakhtar-donetsk/2254/" target="_blank">Shakhtar dominated the Ukraine league</a> in the last decade and they won the Uefa Cup in 2009, Fernandinho made himself noticed last year in Champions League group stages.</p>
<p>The Brazilian playmaker is one of the few top player who can play on both fronts, attack and defence. He is the type of player that is called &#8220;box to box&#8221; midfielder. His passing and long shots makes him a complete player and that&#8217;s why City wanted him so much.</p>
<p>On the other part we must say that Lucescu, the Shakhtar coach, did not wanted to let his star leave for less that 40 millions which was his release clause.</p>
<p>City will appoint a new coach soon and it is believed that Manuel Pellegrini will be announced in the following days.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The winner of this year&#8217;s Europa League will be decided this evening. Chelsea will play against Benfica on Amsterdam Arena.</p>
<p>According to betting odds from <a title="Unibet" href="http://www.unibet.co.uk/betting" target="_blank">Unibet</a>, Chelsea are clear favorites to win the game and bring the trophy to Stamford Bridge. It&#8217;s worth to mention that this is the first Europa League final between two teams that came from Champions League. This could easily have been the Champions League final.</p>
<p>Also Chelsea have the chance to win both Europa League trophies in consecutive years, which will be a first. If the London club will win the competition then it will be fourth club which has won all three European club competitions. Juventus, Ajax and Bayern Munich are the other three clubs that have done that.</p>
<p>On the other side Benfica have lost only one game since September last year but that match could cost them the title in Portugal. With only two games left to play Benfica were first in the standings, two points above their arch-rivals FC Porto but things have changed after last game. Porto managed to win the game in the last minute and now Benfica have small chances of winning the title.</p>
<p>Those from Benfica fear the worst in the last act as they have lost all of the last six European finals since 1962. Coincidence or not that was after Hungarian coach Bella Guttmann, who has won two consecutive Champions Leagues in 1961 and 1962 with the club, said that Benfica do not deserve to win another European trophy. All this happened because Benfica&#8217;s president refused to increase his salary.</p>
<p>Now more and more Benfica fans think that this is a curse. In 1990 before the Champions League final Eusebio went to Vienna to Bella Gutmann grave to try to remove the curse but unfortunately for them Benfica lost the game by 1 &#8211; 0.</p>
<p>Even so there are some optimist players in their squad. Nicolas Gaitan believes that Benfica will win the game and so he will follow the steps of his idol, Diego Maradona who won the cup in 1989. Also Sven-Goran Eriksson believes in a victory for the Lisabona team. Their main advantage in his opinion is that they play a quick football and have a lot of technical gifted players.</p>
<p>The London club has  a moral advantage. Chelsea and Benfica met last year in Champions League quarter final and the England club has won both games, 2 &#8211; 1 and 1 &#8211; 0.</p>
<p>John Terry and Eden Hazard will miss the game due to injuries while on the other side the squad is complete. This will be the second consecutive European final miss for Chelsea&#8217;s captain John Terry.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Real Madrid had one of the best games in the last couple of the years. It was the first game in this Champions League season.</p>
<p>The Spanish giants are in a &#8220;death group&#8221; along with Manchester City, Borussia Dortmund and Ajax. Each team from this group have won the title in their country last year.</p>
<p>Premier League, Primera Division and Bundesliga are considered the best leagues in Europe and have the best ratings as all three countries have 4 allocated places for Champions League. Ajax as well is not a team to not take in consideration. Even if the glorious days have gone, Ajax can cause problems to any of the group teams.</p>
<p>Real Madrid played their first game at home against Manchester City. In the first half Real played with three defensive midfielders and were more cautious.</p>
<p>Anyway in the second half Mourinho forced the attack by trowing into the battle Ozil, Modric and Benzema.</p>
<p>Even if Real Madrid have dominated the game it was Manchester City who opened the score after Dzeko finished a superb counter.</p>
<p>Madrid players didn&#8217;t gave up and Marcelo equalized with a super right foot shout. The Spanish giants forced the win but City made another blow when Kolarov scored from a free-kick.</p>
<p>Real attacked in waves and when there were only three minuted from time Benzema managed to equalize with a well placed shoot. Ronaldo added the happiness into the stadium in the stoppage time when he beat Joe Hart with a cross shoot.</p>
<p>What is to be mentioned is that Real Madrid came back from behind two times and that they managed to win a game against one of the Champions League favorites. And that reminds us of that invincible team with Ronaldo, Zidane, Beckham and Figo.</p>
<p>If they will continue to play like they played last night then Real have big chances of winning the Champions League trophy this year.<br />
