<p>Latest rumors from Spain suggest that Real Madrid are prepared to offer up to €350 million to sign Neymar from PSG. Also they are willing to make him the best paid football player by offering him € 45 million per season.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.onlinesportson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/real-madrid-stadium.jpg" alt="Santiago Bernabeu" class="wp-image-3668" srcset="http://www.onlinesportson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/real-madrid-stadium.jpg 800w, http://www.onlinesportson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/real-madrid-stadium-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.onlinesportson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/real-madrid-stadium-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption>Santiago Bernabeu</figcaption></figure>



<p>After winning three consecutive Campions League titles, Real Madrid have one of the worst seasons. They were eliminated from Champions League, Spainish Cup, and 15 points behind their rivals from Barcelona in LaLiga standings.</p>



<p>Real have scored only 43 goals in 26 games this season, and it looks like Ronaldo&#8217;s departure was a bad decision. Ronaldo joined Juventus last summer after failing to reach another agreement with the board. The transfer sum was around €112 million. Also Zidane&#8217;s decision to leave the club affected the players morale.</p>



<p>Another possible reason for this disastrous season might be the players age. Most of the starting line-up players are above 30 years old, and some of them have passed their best.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why Real Madrid will probably invest massively this summer, and Neymar is their main target. Kylian Mbappe is also on their list but is believed that the French star will be harder to convince to leave his country.</p>



<p>Of course some players will also leave Bernabeu. Bale, Isco, Kroos, Marcelo are the first names on the list but not only.</p>



<p>One thing is sure,Real Madrid will have to spent big  if they are willing to return to winning days.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck has insisted the club will &#8220;do what they have to do&#8221; to keep Eden Hazard at Stamford Bridge amid continued speculation over the Belgian star&#8217;s future. Hazard&#8217;s current contract at Chelsea expires at the end of next season, and Real Madrid have made no secret over the fact they are monitoring the forward&#8217;s situation in London. The 27-year old has only increased speculation regarding his future by admitting it would be a <a href="http://www.espn.co.uk/football/soccer-transfers/story/3661907/chelseas-eden-hazard-real-madrid-move-remains-my-dream" target="_blank" rel="noopener">childhood dream to play for Spanish giants</a>, who themselves are looking for someone to fill the sizeable boots left by Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
<p>Hazard has started this season where he left the last, playing a key role in head coach Maurizio Sarri&#8217;s impressive start to life in England, scoring seven league goals in his first eight appearances of the campaign. On the back of a sensational couple of seasons in the Premier League, Real Madrid appear to have made the forward their number-one priority, targeting Hazard as the man to fill the gap left by Ronaldo&#8217;s departure to Juventus during the summer.</p>
<p>Chelsea&#8217;s plan to keep Hazard at the club appears to be to offer their star man a huge new contract. But, at this stage of his career, it might not be just money that motivates the Belgium international. Without Champions League football this season, Hazard&#8217;s hopes of challenging the likes of Ronaldo and Lionel Messi for the tag as the world&#8217;s best player will be tough. While it&#8217;s looking likely that Chelsea will return to European football&#8217;s elite next season, currently second in the table and as <a href="https://extra.bet365.com/news/en/football/premier-league" target="_blank" rel="noopener">short as 1/5 with the Premier League betting odds</a> to finish in the top four this year, it may not be enough to convince Hazard to stay.</p>
<p>With his contract now entering the final 18 months, Chelsea will need to know whether or not their talisman intends on staying beyond his current deal, with a huge transfer fee at stake should he be allowed to run his contract down. And when looking at world football, it&#8217;s not hard to see why Real are so keen on Hazard. Aside from Ronaldo and Messi, Hazard has a very strong case to suggest he is the best player in the world at the moment. And with the Belgian seemingly open to moving to the Bernabeu, it&#8217;s looking as though Chelsea have a real battle on their hands to keep their main man.<br />
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aVERh3FSWl8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><br />
That all said, Hazard has never come out to claim he will push for a move from the club he joined six years ago from French side Lille. While he hasn&#8217;t hidden his desire to play at the highest level, nor his respect and admiration for Real Madrid, so far, at least, Hazard has maintained a professional air regarding his future &#8211; something that perhaps <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/06/thibaut-courtois-fails-to-report-for-training-chelsea" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wasn&#8217;t the case for his compatriot Thibaut Courtois</a> in the run-up to his switch to Madrid.</p>
<p>The fact remains, however, that when Real find a player they really want to sign, it&#8217;s very rare they don&#8217;t get their man.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Transfer expert Guillem Balague has revealed that Premier League side Tottenham Hotspur inserted a buy-back clause when they sold Welsh international Gareth Bale to Real Madrid for a world-record fee.</p>
<p>The 28-year-old attacked joined Real Madrid for a <a href="http://www.bbc.com/sport/football/23538218" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported £85million million in the summer of 2013</a> and it has been previously reported that the North London club have first option to re-sign him.</p>
<p>In a Question and Answer on the <a href="http://www.skysports.com/football/news/12087/11135499/atletico-madrid-are-preparing-for-antoine-griezmanns-summer-exit-says-guillem-balague" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sky Sports website</a>, Balague confirmed that Spurs have first option to sign the Welshman in any future race for his signature.</p>
<p>Balague, as quoted via <a href="http://www.skysports.com/football/news/12087/11135499/atletico-madrid-are-preparing-for-antoine-griezmanns-summer-exit-says-guillem-balague" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sky Sports</a> said: “If there is any offer for Bale, Real have to contact Spurs and ask them if they want to match it.”“So yes, there is a clause.”</p>
<p>Bale developed into one of the most brilliant attacker during his four-year spell at White Hart lane, netting 26 goals and providing 15 assists both in Tottenham’s <a href="http://footballweeks.com/summary-premier-league-table-england-results-fixtures-tables-news/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epl fixtures</a> and across all competitions in a sensational final season at the White Hart Lane.</p>
<p><strong>Return of Gareth Bale good move for Tottenham Hotspur?</strong></p>
<p>Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino is on the record as being a firm admirer of the Welshman, who is widely regarded as one of the best to represent the Spurs. Sure, Bale has constantly been hit with injuries in the last two seasons, but his record at Bernabeu makes it clear that he is the real deal. With Real Madrid, he has won the Champions League three times and the Spanish title, scoring 70 goals and providing 55 assists across 159 matches.</p>
<p>Get the latest <a href="https://freebets.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free bets uk</a> &amp; online betting offers from leading UK bookmaker by clicking on the link.</p>
<p>Without any doubt, Bale would provide the final piece of the jigsaw in Pochettino’s young and vibrant team which has made Europe sit up and take notice with their stunning transformation.</p>
<p><strong>How ground of his move to Tottenham happening</strong></p>
<p>The price of Bale leaving Real Madrid would have to be right, and it would surely coast a whooping £60million-plus fee for such a great attacker, even one who has suffered with a lot of injuries in recent times. His next move is almost certain to be back to the Premier League and the Welshman will be not short of offers. However, he might end up joining either Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea as Tottenham cannot match the financial resources of the Manchester clubs and the West London club, but Spurs, but they can provide a grand stage, romance and a team on the up. Don’t rule this one out.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Neymar&#8217;s transfer from Barcelona to PSG surprised every football fan and not only.</p>
<p>PSG activated the player&#8217;s transfer release clause of €222 million and brought Neymar to Parc des Princes. The transfer represents the world record fee by far as the previous record was held by Manchester United&#8217;s Pauld Pogba(€105 million).</p>
<p>With those €222 millions the initial budget has increased significantly and now Ernesto Valverde has enough money to strengthen all the departments. According to <a href="https://www.freebetsgb.co.uk/casino/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest casino betting offers</a> Barcelona have identified four targets that would strengthen the team for the new season.</p>
<p>The first player on their list is central defender Inigo Martinez. Even if Real Sociedad are not willing to sell the player, Barcelona might opt to pay the release clause which is supposed to be around €32 million. The Spanish defender is one of the most important players at Sociedad and Valverde is confident that he will also became an important player at Barcelona.</p>
<p>The second player on Barcelona&#8217;s list is Jean Mickael Seri. The Ivory Coast midfielder has had an tremendous rise in the last year. Nice brought him in 2015 from Pacos and since then he became an important player for the French team. Nice finished 3rd in the French league last season and the Ivorian midfielder played an important part. The deal would be around €40 million a sum that is considered acceptable by the Spanish giants.</p>
<p>The 3rd player on their list is Ousmane Dembele. The 20 years old French attacker was a target for Barcelona also last year but in the end the player chose Dortmund as he considered that he would have more chances to play and grow his game.</p>
<p>After a season in which he played 49 games, scored 10 goals and 18 assists, the Catalans are considering him a player capable of replacing Neymar. Even if Dortmund are expecting around €150 millions on him it is believed that the clubs will reach an agreement before the transfer period ends.</p>
<p>The 4th on the list, and maybe the most important, is Brazilian Philippe Coutinho from Liverpool who is Neymar&#8217;s coleague at Brazial national squad. If Barcelona would manage to buy Coutinho that would have an impact also on the market as the Brazilian is one of the best players in Premier League and not only.</p>
<p>Liverpool is not willing to let their star leave the club and already refused 2 offers from Barcelona. The last offer was around €100 millions and even if Barcelona is willing to increase their offer Jurgen Klopp is determined to refuse all the offers.</p>
<p>There are more players of Barcelona list but these are the main names and Ernesto Valverde is confident that he can stop Real Madrid domination in Primera Division and Champions League if all these transfers would succeed.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With only 10 games until the end of the season, Barcelona are very close to win the Primera Division title again. Real Madrid have made too many mistakes, as they are now 12 points behind, and it&#8217;s almost impossible to came back in the title race.</p>
<p>The only team that can put them into trouble at the moment are Atletico Madrid. Diego Simeone has managed to build a very strong and united group at Vicente Calderon. There are not too many star players in the team but they still manage to be among the best teams in Europe.</p>
<p>Even if they are 8 points behind leaders Barcelona they remain in the title race. Fernando Torres was one of the key players in the last couple of games. Torres scored 3 very important goals in the last 5 games.</p>
<p>The Spanish striker, who is a product of Atletico Madrid academy was brought to Premier League in 2007. The British stile fit perfectly for him and he became shortly one of the best player in Europe. He was named in Fifa World XI two times, in 2008 and 2009. After almost four seasons Torres left Liverpool for rivals Chelsea for a British record transfer fee of £50 million, which made him the most expensive Spanish player in history. He failed to adapt to Chelsea style and after three and a half seasons spent at Chalsea Torres tried a new challenge and move to AC Milan in 2014. After another disappointing half of the season the only option was a return to Atletico.</p>
<p>After a less successful first season it seems that the striker slowly returns to form that put him on the list with the best players in the World.</p>
<p>If at the beginning of the season, Atletico did not seem convinced to offer him a contract extension, now with the good form and the decisive goals from the last matches the things have changed. So, what do you think? Will Fernando Torres return at Stade de France, <a href="http://sports.williamhill.com/bet/en-gb/events/euro-2016" target="_blank">where is the Euro 2016 final being held</a>?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Real Madrid winger, Di Maria, is very close to reach an agreement with Manchester United. The 26 years old midfielder would cost Manchester around €80 millions, a record transfer fee.</p>
<p>The Argentinean will sign a five year contract <span style="color: #081f2c;">€375,000 a week. Di Maria will become one of the best paid players at Manchester along with Rooney. The whole deal could cost Manchester over €180 millions.</span></p>
<p>Di Maria was one of the best players at Real Madrid last season, but the arrivals of Toni Kroos and James Rodriguez limited his chances of being in the first eleven.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Atletico Madrid are interested in signing Manchester City&#8217;s forward Alvaro Negredo. The Spanish giants are looking for a replacement for Diego Costa who will probably join Chelsea after the Brazil World Cup.</p>
<p>Atletico are willing to offer up to €31 millions for the Spanish international. Negredo had a good start at City but his performances decreased at the end of the season.</p>
<p>If the move will be done City will make a small some profit from the player sale as Negredo was brought for around €25 millions.</p>
<p>Negredo failed to make the squad for the World Cup but even so he remains one of the best Spanish strikers.</p>
<p>Atletico will have to reorganize quickly as David Villa will also leave the club.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Barcelona are still searching for a defender to strengthen the team. Charles Puyol has past his best as he is 35 years old now and suffered a lot of injuries lately.</p>
<p>A long term replacement is needed and Barcelona are trying to find the best solution. But as Pique has said is not an easy task to find the right defender that would suit Barcelona&#8217;s style of play.</p>
<p><a title="The Spanish giants have tried to sign Marquinhos" href="http://www.onlinesportson.net/psg-are-interested-in-signing-thiago-silva.html">The Spanish giants have tried to sign </a>Marquinhos from Roma and Thiago Silva from PSG but none of the deals have materialized. Now Barcelona have turn their attention on David Luiz from Chelsea and Daniel Agger from Liverpool.</p>
<p>It is believed that Barcelona have already made offers for both players €25 millions for Luiz and €20 millions for Agger.</p>
<p>David Luiz is ready to accept a cut on his wages in order to be able to join Barcelona but the decision will be made by Mourinho. The Portuguese manager declared that David Luiz is not for sale.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Gareth Bale is one of the best players in the World at the moment and also one of the most wanted players. Real Madrid, Barcelona, PSG and Manchester United are among the teams that want the 24 years old midfielder.</p>
<p>Bale had an extraordinary last season when he managed to score 21 goals in Premier League. Even so Tottenham failed to qualify for Champions League. It is believed that Bale was promised that he will be allowed to leave the club if Tottenham will miss Champions League qualification spot. Sadly for Spurs the <a title="Scores" href="http://www.scores.co.uk/" target="_blank">Scores </a>didn&#8217;t go in their favour.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s clear that the player want to leave. When a club like Real Madrid makes a bid for a player it&#8217;s hard for any football player to refuse it.</p>
<p>Most of the football fans believe that Bale should join Real in order to become the best in the World. There are also a few who consider that it&#8217;s too early for him and that he should stay for another year to be ready for the next level. There are a lot of examples when players joined bigger teams and after a few games they failed to impose into the starting lineup.</p>
<p>Real Madrid had an offer of around €90 millions refused by Tottenham but it&#8217;s believed that they will come out with an improved offer of €115 millions. If the deal will be made it will exceed the €91 millions World record payed by Real Madrid for Ronaldo in 2009.</p>
