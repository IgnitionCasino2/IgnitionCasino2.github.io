<p>The qualifying rounds for next year’s European Championships are drawing to a close, so now is a perfect time to recap on what we’ve seen so far and weigh up the chances of the main contenders.</p>



<p>Euro 2020 will celebrate the 60th anniversary of the international competition, which is why UEFA have decided to mix things up a little bit this time around. Rather than one or two host countries, a grand total of 12 nations will have the honour of hosting different matches throughout the tournament. The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="final is set to be held in London’s Wembley Stadium (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.wembleystadium.com/uefa-euro-2020" target="_blank">final is set to be held in London’s Wembley Stadium</a> on 12 July.</p>



<p>As reigning champions, Portugal will once again turn to talisman Cristiano Ronaldo as they look to retain their Euro crown. That said, there are a handful of other teams that have shown incredible intent during the qualifying rounds, many of which find themselves tipped to take home the trophy themselves. Let’s take a closer look.</p>



<p><strong>France – 4/1</strong></p>



<p>Hot off the back of their World Cup triumph in Russia last year, head coach Didier Deschamps will be confident of going all the way once again with his dynamic French side. Les Blues count the likes of Kylian Mbappe, Antoine Griezmann and N&#8217;Golo Kante among their ranks, as well as a host of other top talent jostling for position in both the starting eleven and on the bench.</p>



<p>Their qualifying campaign has offered no signs that the world champions will be easily toppled, so it’s no surprise to find the team currently listed as 4/1 favourites according to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="latest international football betting odds at bet365. (opens in a new tab)" href="https://extra.bet365.com/news/en/football/international-football" target="_blank">latest international football betting odds at bet365.</a></p>



<p><strong>England – 5/1</strong></p>



<iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FEnglandTeam%2Fphotos%2Fa.10150621820502447%2F10156267086727447%2F%3Ftype%3D3&#038;width=500" width="500" height="459" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>



<p>Following a noteworthy run to the semi-finals at last year’s World Cup, it’s fair to say that this young England squad have established a solid foundation to build on. Gareth Southgate will be pleased with his team’s showing throughout the qualifying rounds, particularly <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="the goalscoring threat of Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling. (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.thefa.com/england/mens-seniors/squad/raheem-sterling" target="_blank">the goalscoring threat of Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling.</a></p>



<p>It’s hard to remember the last time England entered a major international competition in such an optimistic light, only narrowly listed behind France as favourites to go all the way next June. Yes, the squad boasts plenty of fresh talent, though a large part of their recent success is down to Southgate’s long-term focus on sports psychology and commitment to developing a strong collective mentality.</p>



<p><strong>Belgium – 7/1</strong></p>



<iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FBelgianRedDevils%2Fphotos%2Fa.123067354504678%2F1733438013467596%2F%3Ftype%3D3&#038;width=500" width="500" height="391" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>



<p>Led by manager Roberto Martinez, this crop of Belgian talent really is something special. In fact, few teams in contention for the Euro 2020 trophy can match the sheer depth of talent that Belgium has to offer. Midfield dynamo Kevin de Bruyne is at the heart of their play, so it’ll be interesting to see how different sides intent to subdue the obvious playmaking threat he poses. Even beyond De Bruyne, there’s also the likes of Eden Hazard, Romelu Lukaku and Dries Mertens to deal with.</p>



<p>Belgium have never won a major international tournament, having previously lost the European Championship final in 1980. They’ll be hoping to go one better this time around.</p>



<p>So, there we have it: our three top picks that look set to go very deep into the latter stages of next year’s Euro 2020. Who’s your money on?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Following a disappointing exit at the 2018 World Cup held in Russia, Joachim Low will still be retaining his post as Germany&#8217;s manager despite his team eviction at the group stage.</p>
<p>With strong rumours linking the Die Mannschaft&#8217;s manager to the Premier League also claiming Low is on the verge of being replaced this summer.</p>
<p>However, with latest media conference the German FA (DFB) will be keeping their manager who helped them to World Cup victory four years ago, after seeing him as the current best manager to reform the Die Mannschaft team for another World Cup to qualify for.</p>
<p>The German FA releases a statement via their <a href="https://twitter.com/DFB_Team_EN/status/1014118068166029313?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1014118068166029313&amp;ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.skysports.com%2Ffootball%2Fnews%2F12023%2F11424729%2Fjoachim-low-to-remain-germany-head-coach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitter account</a>: &#8220;Joachim #Löw will continue as #DieMannschaft head coach&#8221;</p>
<p>The statement confirms that the German manager will be managing the Die Mannschaft till the end of newly signed contract which is set to expire in the summer of 2022 &#8211; when Qatar will be hosting the next World Cup.</p>
<p>Low said: “I feel, in spite of the legitimate criticism of our departure, generally much support and encouragement.<br />
zz<br />
“But now I want to design the rebuilding with full commitment. It all takes time, but everything will happen in time for the start of the new international season in September.”</p>
<p>With that being said, National team director Oliver Bierhoff also added his, saying via <a href="http://www.skysports.com/football/news/12023/11424729/joachim-low-to-remain-germany-head-coach" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sky Sports</a>: “I am very pleased that Jogi Löw is at the helm of our national team and we sat together for a long time yesterday and I felt the full energy to continue.</p>
<p>“After 14 years of successful work, we now have to rebuild and we will now be thinking about it and about further structural changes.”</p>
<p>The Germany national team suffered their first catastrophic eviction away from the biggest football tournament in Russia, being eliminated from the group stage for the first time since 1938. Experts in the field of <a href="https://footballpredictions.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">football predictions</a> didn’t expect Germany to fail this hard: They ended their World Cup campaign at the bottom of the Group F.</p>
<p>Succumbing to their first defeat of the tournament to Mexico in a 1-0 win to the El Tri, but immediately found their feet in their next game against Sweden which they won 2-1 and a 2-0 loss to South Korea all but secured their return to Germany.</p>
<p>With some spectator claiming the Die Mannschaft return to Germany was not the Joachim Low&#8217;s failing tactics fault. Low has guided his National side to the semi-finals of every major tournament since his appointment as manager in 2006, which result to 2014 World Cup and 2017 European Championship glory.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Kalinic is Out of the World Cup</strong></p>
<p>Croatia has decided to send Nikola Kalinic, who may from here on out be ever known as the Reluctant Substitute, back home, ending what turned out to be a very short stint at the World Cup in Russia rather disgracefully.</p>
<p>The striker refused to leave the bench during the game against Nigeria, and this was the straw that broke the camel’s back, since he had done the exact same thing in a friendly against Brazil.</p>
<p><strong>Dalic Confirms the Decision to Play Without Kalinic</strong></p>
<p>Zlatko Dalic, the manager for the Croatian team, confirmed in a statement on Monday that the forward was no longer a part of the team. Dalic said that Kalinic had claimed he wasn’t fit enough to head on to the field during the Group D match, which Croatia managed to win without the sickly striker, with a final score of 2 &#8211; 0.</p>
<p><strong>Dalic Gives Some Details as to Why He’s Booted Kalinic</strong></p>
<p>Dalic said that Kalinic was warming up for the encounter with the Nigerians, and was scheduled to play during the second half. Apparently he then said that he wasn’t able to, due to a vague issue with his back.</p>
<p>Dalic then stated that the same thing had happened during the Brazil friendly which took place previously in England, and had once again come up before the practice session prior to the game against Nigeria.</p>
<p>Dalic confirmed that he accepts Kalinic’s self-diagnosis, but said that he needed <a href="https://cabernetsports.net/sports-performance/yoga-and-fitness-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">players who were fit and ready to play</a>, and that this is why he has chosen to relieve Kalinic of his position with the national team.</p>
<p><strong>Dalic Didn’t Make the Decision Alone</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://hns-cff.hr/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Croatian Football Association</a> has stated that Dalic consulted with his coaching staff before removing Kalinic. The decision was confirmed a few hours after rumours of the player’s dismissal started circling in the press in Croatia.</p>
<p>After the match Dalic had alluded to a problem in the camp, but would not elaborate. He also would not initially respond to any questions regarding Kalinic.</p>
<p><strong>A Disappointing Year for Kalinic</strong></p>
<p>As punters who enjoy football thanks to the <a href="https://livebetting.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online betting NZ</a> offers will know, Kalinic has played for Croatia 41 times, and has scored 15 goals for the team. But he last started for them in 2017.</p>
<p>Dalic has chosen to play Mario Mandzukic, from Juventus, as his main World Cup striker, and has put Andrej Kramaric from Hoffenheim in the support position.</p>
<p>This disgrace bookmarks what has been an anticlimactic year for Kalinic. The 30-year old player had a very underwhelming season when he was at Milan, on loan, scoring only six goals in the 31 games he appeared in.</p>
<p>Reports are suggesting that the player, formerly of Blackburn Rovers, may well be sold by his parent club, Fiorentina. There are apparently a number of Turkish clubs who have expressed interest.</p>
<p>As far as the Croats are concerned, they are going to have to see the rest of the tournament through with only 22 players, since no replacements are permitted at this stage.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Did Mexico&#8217;s Win Over Germany Cause an Earthquake?</strong></p>
<p>Late in the morning of Sunday the 17th of June, Mexico City’s seismic sensors picked up what was reportedly a minor earthquake. But it was not triggered naturally, says the group in charge of monitoring the gauges.</p>
<p>The Institute of Geologic and Atmospheric Investigations in Mexico, the group in question, said that it has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/17/world/americas/mexico-soccer-world-cup.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">quite possibly been caused because of mass jumping</a>. Apparently at least two sensors picked up the activity. The cause for the jumping?</p>
<p><strong>The Mexicans Routed Germany</strong></p>
<p>As football punters enjoying the World Cup thanks to <a href="https://australiansportsbetting.net.au/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Australian sports betting</a> will be able to tell you, moments previously Mexico had managed to score a goal against Germany. The Mexican men’s national football team scored against the European powerhouse in their Group Stage match in the World Cup in Moscow.</p>
<p>The Mexicans went on to to win the match outright, at 1 — 0, defeating the World Cup Champions and taking a place of pride in one of the biggest upsets in the history of Mexico’s World Cup participation.</p>
<p><strong>Clear Indications of How Much the Win Means</strong></p>
<p>One need only glance at Mexico City’s seismographs to get an idea of how important this victory was to the country. But there was a lot of other evidence as well.</p>
<p>After the final whistle blew, households all over the country erupted in celebration, with people pouring in to the streets to share their joy. Strangers embraced one another as family, and the jubilation went on for ages.</p>
<p><strong>Finally Some Good News for Mexico</strong></p>
<p>Car horns created a cacophony for a long time, and elated fans transformed public plazas into huge parties, with Mexican flags being waved, songs being sung, and chanting accompanying the celebratory drinks and sprays of foam.</p>
<p>This jubilation was obviously not simply about the win. For many, the victory was not just the first major World Cup surprise, but finally something for Mexico to celebrate in the face of grim news for the county alongside a <a href="https://quizmymates.com/history/political-scandals-rocked-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">political campaign</a> season that is becoming progressively more toxic.</p>
<p>The elections are set to be held for July 1, and will decide on over 3 000 posts at local, state, and federal levels, including the presidency. And that’s not even mentioning the gradually more outrageous, increasingly more disgusting propaganda being spewed by a certain Cheeto-coloured previous reality star who shall remain nameless here.</p>
<p>Juan Rodrigo Guadarrama, a 32-year old taxi driver in Mexico City spoke for many when he talked about what a wonderful surprise the win had been. He said he had initially not even wanted to watch the game, since he thought that there was no chance that the Mexicans would prevail, and he truly believed he would be watching the one and only game his national team would play. He said that the win has renewed hope for many, and spoke of it bringing people who are polarised and at each other’s throats back together. He added that it made one believe that truly miraculous things were possible!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the World Cup squads having been announced in recent days by all participating nations, the excitement levels are going through the roof. The previous World Cup in Brazil saw many surprises, none more so than the host nation being embarrassed 7-1 by the Germans in the semi-final. The Germans went on to win the trophy against Argentina in extra time, in what turned out to be the most expensive football match ever in terms of ticket prices, <a href="https://www.sbo.net/golden-tickets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with some going for as much as $20,000 a seat</a>. We have taken a look some of the other fun World Cup facts:</p>
<p><img class="alignnone wp-image-3596 size-full" src="http://www.onlinesportson.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/world-cup-russia.jpg" alt="world cup russia" width="640" height="426" srcset="http://www.onlinesportson.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/world-cup-russia.jpg 640w, http://www.onlinesportson.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/world-cup-russia-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></p>
<p><strong>Stadium Distances</strong><br />
Unlike other sporting tournaments like the Olympics, the World Cup is evenly spread throughout a nation. Four years ago in Brazil, there were twelve different stadiums with distances as much as 2,000 miles between them. The journey from Porto Alegre to Fortaleza would have taken over 5 hours one way. Similarly, in Russia, the distance between Yekaterinburg in the east and Kaliningrad in the west is roughly the same distance as London to Moscow!</p>
<p><strong>3.2 Billion Viewers</strong><br />
At the last World Cup in Brazil, a truly incredibly statistic was revealed, which was that almost half of the world’s entire population tuned in to watch the event. When you consider that Brazil is widely regarded as the greatest nation to ever play the beautiful game, then it’s easy to see why. Add to that the golden generation of stars such as Messi and Ronaldo at the peak of their powers, and an England team that somehow always manages to break our hearts!</p>
<p><strong>Baby Booms</strong><br />
It has often been said that the countries that win a World Cup often experience a baby boom in the coming months. This has been noted for numerous countries who have had success in tournaments such as the French in 1998 and the Spanish in 2010. It’s even happened for countries that didn’t even win a tournament, but exceeded expectations. Nine months after Iceland’s stunning victory against England in Euro 2016, hospitals all over the Scandinavian country were suddenly more inhabited than ever before!</p>
<p><strong>3 Million Beers</strong><br />
At the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, a grand total of 750,000 litres of beer were sold at the stadiums, equating to roughly 3 million beers in total. While you may be thinking that’s one hell of a collective hangover in the morning, 390,600 hot dogs were also sold, which must have taken the edge off somewhat!</p>
<p><strong>European Dominance</strong><br />
Out of all the World Cup finals ever played, European teams have only failed to reach the final twice. European nations have won 58.8% of the finals matches that they’ve played in, and it is the Italians and the Germans who are the dominant teams on the continent with 4 titles each to their name and only 1 behind Brazil.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Leicester City have produced one of the biggest surprises in the history of football. Nya Casino Limited and many other betting companies saw Leicester City as one of the candidates for relegation at the start of last season but they produced the biggest surprise and have won the Premier League title.</p>
<p>This can prove to be an inspiration for other small teams like Nice. PSG have easily won the last four titles in France and almost everybody expects the same thing this year, but after 14 rounds Ligue 1 has a surprise leader, Nice.<br />
Even if Nice started the season very well everybody believed that they will not manage to keep up with the favorites PSG or Monaco. Anyway their coach managed to implement trust and a very offensive stile to the players.</p>
<p>After 14 matches Nice are first in Ligue 1 with 33 points, 1 points in front of PSG and Monaco. Many people do not know but this performances come after some important investments started in 2011. Nice wasn&#8217;t on the right way as it was a club from bottom of the table, but they made investments in a new stadium of 35000 places, in their youth academy, scouting and marketing. The club grew up and after five years of investments they proved that they are ready to fight for the title.<br />
It is too soon to say if they can keep up with the big favorites but surely they will give their best to obtain a performance that will make their supporters proud .</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The 2016 UEFA European Championship is slowly dominating sports news, with only three months until the opening ceremony. As the international event is synonymous with England and them never managing to get past the semi-final stage, all attention is currently on whether they can make this year theirs.</p>
<p>After the success of their friendly played against Germany on March 26th, the question of whether England have learnt anything from Germany’s victory in the 2014 World Cup would appear to have been put to bed. Having been two-nil down for the majority of the match, England’s impressive fight and passion to regain control, despite the mantra of ‘it’s only a friendly’, helped fans catch <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/mar/26/germany-england-international-friendly-match-report" target="_blank">a glimpse of what Roy Hodgson’s England team is capable of</a>. Which in turn spurred on comments from the likes of renowned Newcastle player Malcolm Macdonald, who believes that England can present themselves as a serious Euro 16 threat.</p>
<p>In his commentary on the England side, Macdonald stated that the club now has strikers that can instill worry into a lot of European teams taking part, something which England had lacked in prior UEFA Championships. He focused his attention on Leicester&#8217;s Jamie Vardy and Tottenham’s Harry Kane, however, it was Wayne Rooney who he pinpointed <a href="http://www.dailystar.co.uk/sport/football/503815/Newcastle-Malcolm-Macdonald-England-firepower-Euro-2016" target="_blank">as being key to this pairing</a>. Rooney could take on a kind of puppeteer role and pull all the strings, enabling a strong force to dominate the pitch, or at least that is what Macdonald believes. That being said, while a <a href="http://sports.coral.co.uk/football/international/euro-2016" target="_blank">bet on Euro 2016 at Coral</a> is a must for virtually all fans, pinning hopes on the Manchester United captain might not be wise as it appears that Roy Hodgson has yet to confirm where the former Everton stars places in the team.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that Rooney will be in the final 23 strong team, however, there is mounting <a href="http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/655927/Wayne-Rooney-England-Euro-2016-Roy-Hodgson-Holland-Wembley-Harry-Kane-Jamie-Vardy-News" target="_blank">pressure as to what role he will assume</a>, and whether Kane could replace him in the starting line up. Due to a knee injury, Rooney was unable to play in the friendly against Germany and Holland, and despite the fact that the Holland match didn’t go in England’s favour, there is still a lot of hope surrounding the current team put forward. This is most apparent in some of the fantasy teams that commentators are putting together after the Holland loss on Tuesday March 29th; <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/03/28/england-vs-holland-what-tv-channel-is-it-on/" target="_blank">not once in the lineup is Rooney mentioned</a>.</p>
<p>The argument for getting rid of Rooney in the first England team is something that is growing in popularity, and as such adds more intensity to the Wayne Rooney Euro 2016 question in general. Currently the player seems to be safe, but for how long is undoubtedly what many fans and backers are asking as they continue to cast their eyes to the fluctuating Euro 2016 odds.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>FC Barcelona have managed to win the fifth trophy in 2015, after beating South American champions River Plate 3-0 in the final of FIFA Club World Cup. The European Champions qualified easily to the finals after 3-0 victory against Chinese club Guangzhou Evergrande.</p>
<p>The Uruguayan striker, Luis Suárez,  managed to score all three goals of the semifinal, proving once again that he deserved every penny that were paid for him.</p>
<p>In Sunday&#8217;s match <a href="http://sports.titanbet.co.uk/en/football" target="_blank">football betting</a> fans were expecting a more balanced game but that was not the case. And that was due to the fact that both Messi and Neymar, who were missing the semifinal, have played.</p>
<p>Messi opened the score line  in the 36th minute and Suarez make the double in minutes 49th and 68th.</p>
<p>With this success, Barcelona became the first team in the world who won the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFA_Club_World_Cup" target="_blank">FIFA Club World Cup trophy</a> three times. The first trophy was won in 2009 after a victory against Estudiantes 2-1 while the second was in 2011 against Santos 4-0.</p>
<p>This is the fifth trophy of the year for Luis Enrique&#8217;s men as they won La liga, Copa del Rey, Champions League and European Super Cup.</p>
<p>The Spanish giants missed the chance to win the sixth trophy of the year, Spanish Super Cup. <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/17/athletic-bilbao-barcelona-spanish-super-cup" target="_blank">Atletic Bilbao have won the trophy</a> with 1-5 the overall score.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Marco Reus is one of the most wanted players in Europe, with teams such as Arsenal, Manchester United, Bayern and Real Madrid after him.</p>
<p>The German international contract with BVB ends in 2017 but there is a release clause in his contract of €25 millions. Latest rumors from Spain suggest that Real Madrid have gave up on Reus but they could reenter in the race at the end of the season.</p>
<p>Marco Reus suffered a serious injury in his side&#8217;s 2-2 draw with Paderborn that will keep him out of the field for the rest of year. This could prove to be a good thing for Borussia because the chances leaving the club this winter are smaller.</p>
<p>Borussia are having a disastrous season as they are on a relegation spot in Bundesliga.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>PSG have come to an agreement with Chelsea over the transfer sum of David Luiz. The Brazilian defender would cost £40 millions, a record for PSG.</p>
<p>David Luiz started only 15 games for Chelsea this season as Mourinho preferred John Terry and Gary Cahill in the center of defence. The defender joined Chelsea from Benfica in 2011 for a sum of around £21 millions.</p>
<p>PSG have beaten Barcelona who were also interested in signing the Brazilian. Most of the specialists believe that PSG paid too much for the defender. David Luiz will partner Thiago Silva at the back and this could be one of the best central defender pairings in Europe.</p>
<p>This move could be the end of Marquinhos at PSG. The Brazilian youngster failed to impose at PSG as Alex was preferred most of the time.</p>
<p>Barcelona are interested in signing him and it&#8217;s believed that they would offer up to €35 millions.</p>
