<p>It has been eight weeks since the suspension of the South America’s Champion’s League has been suspended.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The current football season has witnessed some highs and lows. From the dressing rooms, the pitch and the dugout, the football world has witnessed some exceptional drama.</p>



<p>Goals galore, records have been broken, some spellbound moments with managerial changes coming into effect.</p>



<p>We have surely been part of a crazy rollercoaster of managerial changes across Europe. Most managers have been sacked due to some dismal performances from their teams.</p>



<p>According to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="ausportsbetting.org (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.ausportsbetting.org/" target="_blank">ausportsbetting.org</a> one of the prime examples of a club that discards its managers is Watford. The Premier League side has sacked the likes of Javi Garcia and Quique Sanchez Flores this season after a poor run of results. </p>



<p>The two managers joined the list of high profile managers without a job currently.</p>



<p><strong>Unai Emery</strong></p>



<p>Ever since the Spaniard was shown the exit door by the Arsenal hierarchy. He has maintained a low profile without a job.</p>



<p>Unai Emery took over Arsenal after Arsene Wenger departed the club in the 2016-17 season. The seed of downfall for Unai Emery was sown in Baku during the Europa League Final against Chelsea. It was the last nail to the coffin.</p>



<p>This is when the Gunners lost 4-1 to their London rivals. Nevertheless, Arsenal started another season in underwhelming style. And the powers that be at Arsenal were very quick to send Unai Emery packing.</p>



<p><strong>Mauricio Pochettino</strong></p>



<p>Regarded as one of the best tacticians in the European elite. There is no doubt that Pochettino was all set to start a dynasty at Tottenham Hotspurs.</p>



<p>It came as a surprise when the world heard the news that Spurs have sacked Pochettino. After taking them to the UEFA Champions League Finals against Liverpool. Despite, Pochettino side punching above their weights hilariously, Spurs went on and sack the Spaniard.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, the German giants Bayern Munich have eyed Mauricio Pochettino. Bayern Munich are looking for a long-term replacement for Hans-Dieter Flick who is currently in charge until the end of the season.</p>



<p>With all the crazy managerial changes that are taking place in the world of football. You can place your bets at your favourite <a href="https://www.bestusaonlinecasinos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="online casinos (opens in a new tab)">online casinos</a> or sportsbook on where these managers will end up coaching next season. </p>

<p>The qualifying rounds for next year’s European Championships are drawing to a close, so now is a perfect time to recap on what we’ve seen so far and weigh up the chances of the main contenders.</p>



<p>Euro 2020 will celebrate the 60th anniversary of the international competition, which is why UEFA have decided to mix things up a little bit this time around. Rather than one or two host countries, a grand total of 12 nations will have the honour of hosting different matches throughout the tournament. The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="final is set to be held in London’s Wembley Stadium (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.wembleystadium.com/uefa-euro-2020" target="_blank">final is set to be held in London’s Wembley Stadium</a> on 12 July.</p>



<p>As reigning champions, Portugal will once again turn to talisman Cristiano Ronaldo as they look to retain their Euro crown. That said, there are a handful of other teams that have shown incredible intent during the qualifying rounds, many of which find themselves tipped to take home the trophy themselves. Let’s take a closer look.</p>



<p><strong>France – 4/1</strong></p>



<p>Hot off the back of their World Cup triumph in Russia last year, head coach Didier Deschamps will be confident of going all the way once again with his dynamic French side. Les Blues count the likes of Kylian Mbappe, Antoine Griezmann and N&#8217;Golo Kante among their ranks, as well as a host of other top talent jostling for position in both the starting eleven and on the bench.</p>



<p>Their qualifying campaign has offered no signs that the world champions will be easily toppled, so it’s no surprise to find the team currently listed as 4/1 favourites according to the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="latest international football betting odds at bet365. (opens in a new tab)" href="https://extra.bet365.com/news/en/football/international-football" target="_blank">latest international football betting odds at bet365.</a></p>



<p><strong>England – 5/1</strong></p>



<iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FEnglandTeam%2Fphotos%2Fa.10150621820502447%2F10156267086727447%2F%3Ftype%3D3&#038;width=500" width="500" height="459" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>



<p>Following a noteworthy run to the semi-finals at last year’s World Cup, it’s fair to say that this young England squad have established a solid foundation to build on. Gareth Southgate will be pleased with his team’s showing throughout the qualifying rounds, particularly <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="the goalscoring threat of Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling. (opens in a new tab)" href="http://www.thefa.com/england/mens-seniors/squad/raheem-sterling" target="_blank">the goalscoring threat of Manchester City’s Raheem Sterling.</a></p>



<p>It’s hard to remember the last time England entered a major international competition in such an optimistic light, only narrowly listed behind France as favourites to go all the way next June. Yes, the squad boasts plenty of fresh talent, though a large part of their recent success is down to Southgate’s long-term focus on sports psychology and commitment to developing a strong collective mentality.</p>



<p><strong>Belgium – 7/1</strong></p>



<iframe src="https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FBelgianRedDevils%2Fphotos%2Fa.123067354504678%2F1733438013467596%2F%3Ftype%3D3&#038;width=500" width="500" height="391" style="border:none;overflow:hidden" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowTransparency="true" allow="encrypted-media"></iframe>



<p>Led by manager Roberto Martinez, this crop of Belgian talent really is something special. In fact, few teams in contention for the Euro 2020 trophy can match the sheer depth of talent that Belgium has to offer. Midfield dynamo Kevin de Bruyne is at the heart of their play, so it’ll be interesting to see how different sides intent to subdue the obvious playmaking threat he poses. Even beyond De Bruyne, there’s also the likes of Eden Hazard, Romelu Lukaku and Dries Mertens to deal with.</p>



<p>Belgium have never won a major international tournament, having previously lost the European Championship final in 1980. They’ll be hoping to go one better this time around.</p>



<p>So, there we have it: our three top picks that look set to go very deep into the latter stages of next year’s Euro 2020. Who’s your money on?</p>

<p>After an incredibly <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="bright start to their Euro 2020 qualification bid (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47578575" target="_blank">bright start to their Euro 2020 qualification bid</a>, England are in the driving seat as far as progressing to the finals is concerned and, although it is a tournament that will be hosted across the continent, it does have the air of a home championships at the same time.</p>



<figure><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KpNcoYNfbOs" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure>



<p>That’s because one of the final four meetings and the showpiece event itself, are to be held at England’s Wembley Stadium and this means the Three Lions could be playing some highly important fixtures in very familiar surroundings.</p>



<p>The last time England hosted the European Championships was back in 1996 and it really was the summer in which football did come home. Although Terry Venables’ men were denied an appearance in the final by Germany, it is a tournament that lives long in the memory.</p>



<p>While although the summer of ’96 is now etched in football folklore as far as England fans are concerned, it is perhaps time to stop looking to the past and instead look to what is on offer in this present day and age.</p>



<p></p>



<p>That’s because England have been the nearly-men of international football in the last two years and, after semi-final appearances at both the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA Nations League, the belief is that now is their time.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a belief that is shared by pundits and punters alike; <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="a look at the current international football betting (opens in a new tab)" href="https://extra.bet365.com/news/en/football/international-football" target="_blank">a look at the current international football betting</a> has this young squad well placed to end their international trophy drought – a drought that is now 53 years and counting.</p>



<p>With England currently priced at 9/2 second-favorites with bet365, there is not much standing between them and being kings of Europe next summer. However, that’s not to say they will go unchallenged either.</p>



<p>When discussing the runners and riders for Euro 2020, one cannot leave France out of the conversation and, as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="current World Champions (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/15/france-croatia-world-cup-final-match-report" target="_blank">current World Champions</a>, they will be looking to emulate the achievements of the previous generation some twenty years prior.</p>



<figure><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GrsEAvRerTg" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure>



<p>Back in 2000, David Trezeguet scored a Golden-Goal extra-time winner against Italy, which meant that this legendary French team added the European Championship to their first-ever World Cup win two years before.</p>



<p>Not only that, but France will be looking to go one better after losing in the final of Euro 2016 and, with the rich pedigree that this talented group of players have, it comes as no surprise that bet365 have made them 7/2 favourites to win a third European Championship next year.</p>



<p>Much will depend on the likes of Barcelona’s Antoine Griezmann and Manchester United’s Paul Pogba, who, in the case of the latter, has a recent tendency to play better for his country rather than this club.</p>



<p>Much will depend on the likes of Barcelona’s Antoine Griezmann and Manchester United’s Paul Pogba, who, in the case of the latter, has a recent tendency to play better for his country rather than this club.</p>



<p>However, if they fail to lead France to success, then a certain Harry Kane will be lying in wait and what better sight would there be for English football than the Tottenham forward lifting the Henri Deulauney trophy in front of his countrymen. Time will tell if this fantasy becomes a reality.</p>

<p>Latest rumors from Spain suggest that Real Madrid are prepared to offer up to €350 million to sign Neymar from PSG. Also they are willing to make him the best paid football player by offering him € 45 million per season.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="http://www.onlinesportson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/real-madrid-stadium.jpg" alt="Santiago Bernabeu" class="wp-image-3668" srcset="http://www.onlinesportson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/real-madrid-stadium.jpg 800w, http://www.onlinesportson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/real-madrid-stadium-300x200.jpg 300w, http://www.onlinesportson.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/real-madrid-stadium-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" /><figcaption>Santiago Bernabeu</figcaption></figure>



<p>After winning three consecutive Campions League titles, Real Madrid have one of the worst seasons. They were eliminated from Champions League, Spainish Cup, and 15 points behind their rivals from Barcelona in LaLiga standings.</p>



<p>Real have scored only 43 goals in 26 games this season, and it looks like Ronaldo&#8217;s departure was a bad decision. Ronaldo joined Juventus last summer after failing to reach another agreement with the board. The transfer sum was around €112 million. Also Zidane&#8217;s decision to leave the club affected the players morale.</p>



<p>Another possible reason for this disastrous season might be the players age. Most of the starting line-up players are above 30 years old, and some of them have passed their best.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why Real Madrid will probably invest massively this summer, and Neymar is their main target. Kylian Mbappe is also on their list but is believed that the French star will be harder to convince to leave his country.</p>



<p>Of course some players will also leave Bernabeu. Bale, Isco, Kroos, Marcelo are the first names on the list but not only.</p>



<p>One thing is sure,Real Madrid will have to spent big  if they are willing to return to winning days.</p>

<p>Originally being an activity primarily held at the weekend, the growing popularity and wider range of football fixtures has made it possible to create your own <a href="https://footyaccumulators.com/football-tips">tips for football betting daily </a>each week. All potential outcomes are covered by the extensive markets from the bookmakers, and additional competitions such as the Champions League, Europa League, EFL Cup and FA Cup allow for even more fixtures to place money on.</p>



<p>The masses of options for how you choose to make football betting tips are seen as a positive and a negative, making it easier to bet on exactly what you think is likely to happen, but also being seen as an obstacle for inexperienced punters who struggle to identify what to bet on.It’s likely that another football fixture is on the cards throughout the current week &#8211; as well as plenty of the expected weekend games &#8211; but if you’re looking to bet on one of the many weekday games, we’ve offered a helping hand on how to pick insightful football betting tips between Monday and Friday.</p>



<p><strong>Choose your football fixture(s)</strong></p>



<p>Bookmaker apps and websites provide odds on all scheduled matches several weeks in advance, making it possible to back your bets early and take the best price. Monday night football continues the selection of games at the weekend and you’ll often find a Friday night fixture to kick off the next weekend in a similar style, with games also often played between Tuesday and Thursday, especially for domestic and European competitions. Through choosing your match, which is likely to be from one of Europe’s more recognised leagues, you can create football betting tips as a single, introduce other games to make a football accumulator, or back an enhanced market that’s been boosted by your chosen bookmaker.</p>



<p><strong>Select your method of betting</strong></p>



<p>You might not realise it, but football betting tips come in all different shapes and sizes. With this being the case, you aren’t solely limited to predicting the match result, instead being given the opportunity to bet on every possible outcome over ninety minutes including over 2.5 goals, both teams to score, anytime goalscorers, and many other more extensive options. The bookies continue to cater to a more varied array of different markets to enhance your football betting tips, which helps massively as it prevents you from backing something else due to the fact that you can’t be specific with your football prediction.</p>



<p><strong>Back your bet at the biggest odds</strong></p>



<p>The last port of call for backing any bets is to assure
that you’re placing them at the biggest available odds. It’s easy to do this by
cross-referencing the price you’ve been given over all popular bookmakers, with
it being a worthwhile process as each bookie possesses a different price. You
shouldn’t base your football betting tips on the odds you’re being given, but
they can be an indication of their chances of landing, with higher odds often
meaning that the bookies are doubting that your bet will win.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Travelling across Europe to watch your favourite team play in the Champions League is never a cheap venture, but the amount can vary massively depending on the group stage draw.</p>
<p>This season Manchester City, Liverpool, Tottenham and Manchester United are all competing in Europe’s premier tournament, in the hope that they can propel English club football back to the top.</p>
<p>Manchester City are the current favourites to win the tournament and according to <a href="https://www.betfair.com/exchange/plus/football/competition/228" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Champions League betting</a>, they are 9/2, just ahead of Barcelona who are 5/1.</p>
<p><strong>Manchester City</strong></p>
<p>Despite being the favourites, City lost their opening game, as Lyon stunned the Premier League champions, winning 2-1 at the Etihad Stadium.</p>
<p>City have also travelled to their other two group stage opponents, Hoffenheim and Shakhtar Donetsk and picked up maximum points, renewing their hope of winning a first Champions League title.</p>
<p><strong>Liverpool</strong></p>
<p>The Reds finished as the runners-up in last season’s Champions League, losing out to Real Madrid in the final. This season, they have been drawn against Serie A runners-up Napoli, Ligue 1 winners PSG and Serbian SuperLiga winners Red Star Belgrade.</p>
<p>Liverpool have played one away match so far, a trip to Naples to take on Napoli, a match in which they lost in the dying minutes thanks to a goal from Lorenzo Insigne. Their fans still have trips to Paris and Belgrade to look forward to.</p>
<p><strong>Tottenham Hotspur</strong></p>
<p>When Spurs fans watched the draw for the Champions League group stage this season, alarm bells began to ring as they were drawn against Barcelona, Inter Milan and PSV Eindhoven.</p>
<p>Having failed to win so far, losing away to Inter Milan and at home to Barcelona and then drawing away to PSV, Tottenham’s hopes of reaching the knockout phase have been severely dented. Although Spurs fans have arguably the easiest away trips with regards to journey times, that will be of little comfort given their current form in Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Manchester United</strong></p>
<p>Jose Mourinho has endured a poor start to his third season in charge of Manchester United. The Red Devils currently lie in 8th place in the Premier League and haven’t fared much better in Europe, winning only one of their opening three Champions League matches, away to BSC Young Boys.</p>
<p>United still have to travel to Valencia and Turin before knowing their final position within the group. These away trips will see the Red Devils face a struggling Valencia and a Juventus team who have former United star Cristiano Ronaldo at their disposal.</p>
<p>The infographic below examines the price the English fans must pay to watch their team away in the Champions League.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Chelsea chairman Bruce Buck has insisted the club will &#8220;do what they have to do&#8221; to keep Eden Hazard at Stamford Bridge amid continued speculation over the Belgian star&#8217;s future. Hazard&#8217;s current contract at Chelsea expires at the end of next season, and Real Madrid have made no secret over the fact they are monitoring the forward&#8217;s situation in London. The 27-year old has only increased speculation regarding his future by admitting it would be a <a href="http://www.espn.co.uk/football/soccer-transfers/story/3661907/chelseas-eden-hazard-real-madrid-move-remains-my-dream" target="_blank" rel="noopener">childhood dream to play for Spanish giants</a>, who themselves are looking for someone to fill the sizeable boots left by Cristiano Ronaldo.</p>
<p>Hazard has started this season where he left the last, playing a key role in head coach Maurizio Sarri&#8217;s impressive start to life in England, scoring seven league goals in his first eight appearances of the campaign. On the back of a sensational couple of seasons in the Premier League, Real Madrid appear to have made the forward their number-one priority, targeting Hazard as the man to fill the gap left by Ronaldo&#8217;s departure to Juventus during the summer.</p>
<p>Chelsea&#8217;s plan to keep Hazard at the club appears to be to offer their star man a huge new contract. But, at this stage of his career, it might not be just money that motivates the Belgium international. Without Champions League football this season, Hazard&#8217;s hopes of challenging the likes of Ronaldo and Lionel Messi for the tag as the world&#8217;s best player will be tough. While it&#8217;s looking likely that Chelsea will return to European football&#8217;s elite next season, currently second in the table and as <a href="https://extra.bet365.com/news/en/football/premier-league" target="_blank" rel="noopener">short as 1/5 with the Premier League betting odds</a> to finish in the top four this year, it may not be enough to convince Hazard to stay.</p>
<p>With his contract now entering the final 18 months, Chelsea will need to know whether or not their talisman intends on staying beyond his current deal, with a huge transfer fee at stake should he be allowed to run his contract down. And when looking at world football, it&#8217;s not hard to see why Real are so keen on Hazard. Aside from Ronaldo and Messi, Hazard has a very strong case to suggest he is the best player in the world at the moment. And with the Belgian seemingly open to moving to the Bernabeu, it&#8217;s looking as though Chelsea have a real battle on their hands to keep their main man.<br />
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aVERh3FSWl8" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><br />
That all said, Hazard has never come out to claim he will push for a move from the club he joined six years ago from French side Lille. While he hasn&#8217;t hidden his desire to play at the highest level, nor his respect and admiration for Real Madrid, so far, at least, Hazard has maintained a professional air regarding his future &#8211; something that perhaps <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/aug/06/thibaut-courtois-fails-to-report-for-training-chelsea" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wasn&#8217;t the case for his compatriot Thibaut Courtois</a> in the run-up to his switch to Madrid.</p>
<p>The fact remains, however, that when Real find a player they really want to sign, it&#8217;s very rare they don&#8217;t get their man.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There have already been a number of star performers even at this early stage of the premier league season. Chelsea are the surprise package at present as punters continue to use the latest <a href="https://www.us-bookies.com/fanduel-sportsbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">offer at fanduel</a> to support them for the title. Can they topple the defending champions Manchester City and the attacking powerhouses of Liverpool? Here we cover some of the stars of the season thus far.</p>
<p><strong>ALISSON &#8211; LIVERPOOL</strong></p>
<p>Liverpool’s keeper, Alisson has been a key addition to the squad. He has made a solid start to the season as the club continue to challenge for the league. At present eight games in, he is one of two keepers to have only conceded three goals. He also sits at the top of the table for saved shot percentage, so can be help them end their wait for another league title.</p>
<p><strong>JOHN STONES – MANCHESTER CITY</strong></p>
<p>It is exciting times for English football as the national team continues to go from strength to strength. They are coming off the back of a starring performance in beating Spain, and one player who is continuing to improve is <a href="https://www.transfermarkt.com/john-stones/profil/spieler/186590" target="_blank" rel="noopener">defender, John Stones</a>. The Manchester City defender is proving a revelation at the back since a stuttering start as pressure piled on him due to his big money move. He sits at the top of the interception, clearance and pass completion charts. He is set to play a leading role in their attempt to defend the premier league title.</p>
<p><strong>JORGINHO &#8211; CHELSEA</strong></p>
<p>He does not do anything flash but the impact he has on the team is unquestionable. He followed Chelsea’s new manager Sarri over from Napoli just showing the esteem he is held in. Chelsea are now renowned for the vast amount of passes they make and this is headed by the Italian. Jorginho continues to control the side from the middle and is all but set to break the premier league passing record unless an injury occurs.</p>
<p><strong>EDEN HAZARD– CHELSEA</strong></p>
<p>Another Chelsea player and the current star of the season is Eden Hazard. He kicked off the current campaign in flying form following a starring role for Belgium at the world cup in Russia. He sits at the top of the scoring charts and he really looks to be excelling from the role he is playing under new manager, Sarri. Hazard is now in talks as a future winner of the Ballon d’or but can he first help lead Chelsea to another premier league title.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Diogo Jota was one of the key players in Wolverhampton Wanderers’ impressive Championship promotion campaign last time out, and now the Portuguese youngster will have his sights set on lighting up the Premier League. The former Atletico Madrid man will be crucial in the years to come for Nuno Espirito Santo’s side, and if he can get off to a flying start in the top flight there is no telling how far this team can go.</p>
<p>The progress made at Wolves in the last year is astounding, and the Midlands club have completed some impressive player swoops thanks to their links with super-agent Jorge Mendes. Nuno’s side are a club on the rise, and this is highlighted by the fact that the newly promoted Championship winners aren’t even considered among the favourites for relegation in the season ahead. In fact, at the time of writing, with <a href="http://sports.williamhill.com/bet/en-gb/betting/y/5/Football.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all football odds</a> they can be backed at 9/1 to finish in the top six.</p>
<p>Wolves are expected to do well upon their return to the top flight due to the fact that they have some young stars in their ranks, such as Ruben Neves and Jota. Jota was the club’s top scorer last season, with 17 goals and 5 assists during his loan spell at the Molineux Stadium. Wolves were quick to make the deal <a href="http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11699/11229101/wolves-to-sign-diogo-jota-on-permanent-deal-from-atletico-madrid-at-end-of-season" target="_blank" rel="noopener">permanent</a> this summer, and it could turn out to be an incredible bit of business.<br />
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VoMtK314Rj4" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe><br />
Jota began his senior career at Pacos Ferreira, where he scored 14 goals in 41 league appearances. This attracted the interest of La Liga giants Atletico, but the youngster was immediately loaned out to Porto upon his arrival at the Estadio Vicente Calderon. It was during his time with the Portuguese heavyweights that Jota began to make a name for himself as a potential future star.</p>
<p>At only 21 years old, Wolves have acquired Jota at the perfect time and can mould him into a dangerous weapon in the English top flight. The newly promoted side spent around £12 million on the winger, but this could turn out to be a bargain in today’s market. In fact, if he continues on this trajectory the Portuguese U23 international could be worth triple that in a couple of years.<br />
While Jota was one of the standout names in the lower tier last season, it isn’t always easy for players to make the step up to the top flight. Players like <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/05/18/footballs-inbetweeners-players-good-championship-cant-cut-premier/dwight-gayle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dwight Gayle</a> and Matt Ritchie have been dominant forces in the Championship in the past, but have never quite had the same effect in the Premier League. However, some do succeed. Charlie Adam and Rickie Lambert are two examples of players who managed to bring their second-tier form into the top division.</p>
<p>Wolves have a fairly tough start to their return to the Premier League and will face Everton, Leicester City, and Manchester City in their first three fixtures. In these games, Wolves may be forced to sit back and defend, but Jota could be deadly on the break. If the Portuguese can play his football against these teams, he could easily start his journey towards becoming a top-flight star.</p>
