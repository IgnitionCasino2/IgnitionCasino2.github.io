				<p>It has been eight weeks since the suspension of the South America’s Champion’s League has been
					suspended.</p>



				<p>The league had undergone just six weeks of group phase action. The suspension was due to the
					Coronavirus pandemic. Other leagues such as the European Football League and the Premier Soccer
					league have been affected as well.</p>



				<p>Initially CONMEBOL hoped to restart the league on May 6 but that was not the case as the date came
					and passed.</p>



				<p>What Are the Odds that theFractured Minds (ID@Xbox)- May 19</p>



				<p><strong>League will Resume</strong></p>



				<p>If the administrators do resume the league, they will have to make difficult decisions. The decisions
					include deciding what to do in order to complete the full calendar. They would have to switch to the
					shorter format in order to finish the league. If they do decide to move the league to next year then
					they would have encounter financial loses.


				<p>South America has the most competitive World Cup qualifying on the entire planet</p>



				<p><strong>New Teams That Were Appearing for the First Time in The 2020 Copa America League</strong></p>



				<p>Australia and Qatar had been invited to participate for the first time in the league. It has been the
					tradition of CONMEBOL to invite guest nations to play in the league.</p>



				<p><strong>Copa America 2020 Hosts</strong></p>



				<p>Argentina and Colombia were sharing the duties for the 2020 league. This is the 10th time that
					Argentina has hosted the league.</p>



				<p><strong>Copa America History</strong></p>




				<p><strong>Guest Teams</strong></p>



				<p>CONMEBOL began inviting guest teams in 1993. The first teams to be invited were United States and
					Mexico.</p>



				<p>Copa America had two cups, one of the cups which was named America’s cup was made in 1965. The other
					one was produced in 2016.</p>



				<p><strong>Countries that Participated</strong></p>



				<p>There are a total of 18 countries that have participated until 2019.</p>

				<h1><a href="why-the-nba-draft-system-still-needs-an-overhaul.html" rel="bookmark">Why the NBA draft
						system still needs an overhaul</a></h1>

				<p class="date"><b>Posted on </b>| May 6, 2020 | <a
						href="why-the-nba-draft-system-still-needs-an-overhaul.html#respond">No Comments</a></p>



				<p>Every year the NBA draft is followed by millions of eager basketball fans around the world, as the
					most promising international and college prospects are chosen. The first picks typically go to the
					worst teams from the previous season, within a system that is aimed at making the NBA competitive.
					Nevertheless, it’s also a system with some glaring flaws, which includes encouraging teams to
					underperform and tank, in order to get better picks.</p>



				<p>Perhaps the best example of a team tanking during the 2019-20 season is the Golden State Warriors.
					This is the same franchise which has dominated the NBA in recent years, reaching five consecutive
					NBA Finals since 2015 and winning the championship three times. Now they are completely
					unrecognizable, rock-bottom of the Western Conference and the first team to be mathematically
					eliminated from playoff contention.</p>



				<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aZ5n0pPX5wU" frameborder="0"
					allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
					allowfullscreen></iframe>



				<p>The Milwaukee Bucks convincingly top the Eastern Conference and the Los Angeles Lakers dominate in
					the Western Conference, with both tipped as favorites to reach the Finals prior to the enforced
					break, yet casual observers are unable to
					understand why the Golden State Warriors aren’t up there competing with them. The answer is quite
					simple – the Warriors are tanking to ensure they get better draft options.</p>



				<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WlvU4XlGQy4" frameborder="0"
					allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
					allowfullscreen></iframe>



				<p>In the world of competitive professional sports, it might be hard to comprehend a situation whereby
					losing can be regarded as ultimately more rewarding than winning. However, this is the paradox
					created by the NBA draft system</a>. The aim of the draft is noble,
					for sure, because it gives the worst teams each season a chance to improve.</p>



				<p>Nevertheless, it also creates a situation whereby franchises can exploit that noble aim. Since the
					introduction of the NBA draft, the odds are stacked heavily in favor of the worst teams for
					the first four picks. This means they will get the best new players entering the NBA. Ahead of the
					next NBA draft, the Golden State Warriors are the worst team in either conference, which means they
					have the joint-best odds of landing the highest-ranked players.</p>



				<p>As this <a rel="noreferrer noopener"
						href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1160424-golden-state-warriors-why-the-warriors-tanking-is-hurting-the-nba"
						target="_blank">2012 article published by Bleacher Report highlights</a>, it’s not the first
					time the Warriors have looked ahead to the draft, rather than focus on winning. Back then, the way
					they concluded the season was called into question, apparently valuing better draft options above
					the prestige of competing to finish higher in the league rankings. 2019-20 results have been so bad,
					it seems like the Warriors are taking the same approach to a new extreme.</p>



				<p>In some regards, this has created a race to the bottom where GM’s value first picks in the draft,
					along with the chance to sign a potential All-Star player, ahead of team performance during a season
					that isn’t going so well. For this reason alone, it’s clear that the draft system needs to be
					constantly reviewed and revised.</p>











				<h1><a href="high-profile-football-managers-without-a-job-currently.html" rel="bookmark">High Profile
						Football Managers without a Job Currently</a></h1>

				<p class="date"><b>Posted on </b>| February 12, 2020 | <a
						href="high-profile-football-managers-without-a-job-currently.html#respond">No Comments</a></p>



				<p>The current football season has witnessed some highs and lows. From the dressing rooms, the pitch and
					the dugout, the football world has witnessed some exceptional drama.</p>



				<p>Goals galore, records have been broken, some spellbound moments with managerial changes coming into
					effect.</p>



				<p>We have surely been part of a crazy rollercoaster of managerial changes across Europe. Most managers
					have been sacked due to some dismal performances from their teams.</p>






				<p>The two managers joined the list of high profile managers without a job currently.</p>



				<p><strong>Unai Emery</strong></p>



				<p>Ever since the Spaniard was shown the exit door by the Arsenal hierarchy. He has maintained a low
					profile without a job.</p>



				<p>Unai Emery took over Arsenal after Arsene Wenger departed the club in the 2016-17 season. The seed of
					downfall for Unai Emery was sown in Baku during the Europa League Final against Chelsea. It was the
					last nail to the coffin.</p>



				<p>This is when the Gunners lost 4-1 to their London rivals. Nevertheless, Arsenal started another
					season in underwhelming style. And the powers that be at Arsenal were very quick to send Unai Emery
					packing.</p>



				<p><strong>Mauricio Pochettino</strong></p>



				<p>Regarded as one of the best tacticians in the European elite. There is no doubt that Pochettino was
					all set to start a dynasty at Tottenham Hotspurs.</p>



				<p>It came as a surprise when the world heard the news that Spurs have sacked Pochettino. After taking
					them to the UEFA Champions League Finals against Liverpool. Despite, Pochettino side punching above
					their weights hilariously, Spurs went on and sack the Spaniard.</p>



				<p>Nevertheless, the German giants Bayern Munich have eyed Mauricio Pochettino. Bayern Munich are
					looking for a long-term replacement for Hans-Dieter Flick who is currently in charge until the end
					of the season.</p>

				<h1><a href="should-fifa-introduce-video-replay.html" rel="bookmark">Should Fifa introduce video
						replay?</a></h1>

				<p class="date"><b>Posted on </b>| August 18, 2010 | <a
						href="should-fifa-introduce-video-replay.html#respond">No Comments</a></p>


				<p>The <strong>video replay</strong> one of the most discussed topic in <strong>football </strong>in the
					recent years.</p>
				<p>Everyone expects from the referees to be perfect, or at least to reduce the mistakes during the games
					but it looks that this is a very hard task to do. So everyone tries to find solutions, and <em>Fifa
					</em>is pressed from all sides to come with an alternative.</p>
				<p>In the first phase <em>Fifa </em>tried the system with 6 referees, tested it in Europa League, but
					even this solution doesn&#8217;t seem to be better. There were also speculations that the ball
					should contain a chip to signal when the ball passes the line of the goal but the solutions is not
					well seen by the specialists.</p>
				<p>So at the moment it looks like the only viable solution is the video replay.Regarding the video
					replay the opinions are divided with a plus for it. Fifa is pressed to take a decision especially
					after the World Cup mistakes, when some of them proved to be crucial.</p>
				<p>So after rugby, basketball, tennis or american football we might have video replays also in
					<strong>football</strong>. This decision would bring advantages but not only.</p>
				<p>At advantages we can mention fewer mistakes that can decide games and fewer scandals. On the other
					side the spirit and the charm of the game would suffer.  The game could have more than 10 minutes of
					additional time which could
					determine the players to lose their patience  awaiting for the verdict, the fluidity of the game
					could also suffer.</p>
				<p>The final decision will be taken in November but there are chances for a positive answer.</p>
